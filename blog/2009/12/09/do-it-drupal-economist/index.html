&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moving incrementally and iteratively to Drupal- making improvements as you move bit by bit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User comments and recommendations served from Drupal, along with comment history pages, article comments pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Syncing data to Drupal every 5 minutes-- all content and comments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soon, article pages served from Drupal-- running into a few performance problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next: channel pages served from Drupal, third-party services, registration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We benefit from Drupal sooner by taking this approach; rather than building the whole site in the background and not benefitting until the end, this way we benefit from improved functionality sooner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;The Economist is so old that the guy who started it had to be painted rather than photographed&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The old way&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20-30 mil page views, 3-4 million unique visitors per month - lots of performance and scalability issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Want to build the foremost destination online for analyzing and debating global agenda; want to bring visitors into that debate; current system isn't enough to support this vision, that's why they moved to Drupal particularly for comments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase publishing volume with user-generated content (more content w/o more costs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The old way: custom CMS built on proprietary stack (MS, ColdFusion, Oracle)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blogs were originally MovableType, now are all Drupal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Broken waterfall processes meant frequent fire-fighting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Needed to be more responsive to change, deliver business value sooner (projects take a long time to deliver value to organization), more sustainable, happier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making these changes incrementally and iteratively; &quot;perfect is the enemy of better&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Drupal?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looked at OpenCMS, Alfresco, Joombla, met with other newspapers, considered building a custom system, buying a proprietary system, or going open source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drupal as strategic fit: community and content publishing, robust development framework, development language, free software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strength of Drupal community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selling Drupal internally was a challenge: no suit-wearing Drupal sales force&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attended DrupalCon Boston 2008, networking within community, engaging w/ Lullabot for workshops and training&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proof-of-concept to reproduce article page in Drupal; how to use CCK fields to make a rich article content type&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using Scrum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 million registered users, articles - data migration is daunting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage the move using Scrum - selling it was easy with charts (developing business value sooner and throughout, management can see progress throughout, shining a spotlight on issues/dysfunction and attacking them along the way - risk decreases a lot faster)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take requirements, prioritize based on business value: which are the most important to organization, do those first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trained management team in Scrum, development team in Drupal, then started sprinting with help from consultants (2-week sprints, delivering something of value at the end)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Maybe not the largest Drupal project, but the most expensive&quot; - lots of consultants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrating CMS's&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proxy approach: Drupal sends JSON over HTTP back and forth with Existing ColdFusion system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using native Drupal comments; comments have to be attached for nodes - there has to be a node for every piece of content on the legacy system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create nodes on the fly for every ColdFusion request that comes in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notion of proxy nodes is a pattern that comes up during integration of Drupal with other systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voting API votes used for recommends; these are also attached to proxy nodes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started with proxy approach only; then moved to doing some with subdomain approach - hope to be doing neither soon after moving entirely to Drupal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Migrating data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Migrating and syncing data every 5 minutes - don't wait until the end to figure out that piece&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Table Wizard and Migrate modules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Table Wizard writes Views integration for MySQL tables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Migrate lets you migrate certain views, push into Drupal as nodes/users/taxonomy terms/etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Client is involved in how legacy data gets organized in Drupal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sat down with client to browse through content and decide what data needs to be moved and what it means&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Migrate keeps track of everything you've done, gives you a dashboard, tells you how far along you are - keeps a mapping table, legacy ID, you can check and see what came across and fix things; does your bookkeeping for you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drupal expects to have all the info it needs in its database; something getting published in Oracle needs to be in Drupal promptly - synchronization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did you decide what to put into Drupal first?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business value: comments, user profiles, recommends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many Drupal servers does it take to scale that big?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not entirely sure how many servers we have; let's say +/- 12&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Master MySQL server, a few slave MySQL servers - more important aspects have to do with Pressflow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pressflow = high performance variant of Drupal 6, completely API compatible with Drupal, but it takes some patches that are in Drupal 7 and moves them in to Drupal 6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Varnish's full capability; Varnish = reverse proxy server, takes load off Drupal/PHP/MySQL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you stop people from trying to shove their emergencies into Scrum process?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't want people going directly to the team like they traditionally do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Team, Scrum Master, product owner - customer, person who represents the client, has to have power to make decisions on behalf of organization, responsible for managing stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Product owner comes to team w/ prioritized list of features for next sprint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had two teams in New York and one team in London all doing 3-week iterations in parallel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Split up site into component parts: profiles, article pages, channel pages, had three product owners who had to manage stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Works reasonably well; now we're doing two teams, one system that shows what all teams will do; someone has to keep &quot;product backlog&quot; in order, stopping people from shoving in their &quot;one little thing&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Features&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Base theme is 960 px grid - laying out themes as a series of columns, all sections have to fit into the grid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selenium for &quot;user journey&quot; testing; building environments to help manage configurations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuous integration using Hudson - needed a shared place where user tests could run&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set of servers running on Amazon; Hudson sets off user tests every time there's a commit to the SVN repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apache SOLR search hosted by Acquia- 100,000k articles that have to be available through site search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People were unhappy with relevance of matches in old site search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acquia's hosted search service: really fast, good results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apache SOLR: can start filtering results further and further - faceting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;How do I get SOLR running on my website?&quot; - can self-host, but we went with Acquia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other tools for managing people/process?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Scrum, less about resource management - we just want dedicated co-located teams, don't worry about availability because of multiple projects: single focus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redundancy of function - generalizing specialists, specialists can create bottlenecks/risks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;How many people need to be hit by a bus before your project fails?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;agilemanifesto.org&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Google Docs a lot - project backlogs are all spreadsheets, a big wiki, project dashboards that &quot;radiate information to the rest of the organization&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus is on people, not tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test-driven development, writing tests first can sometime be hard with Drupal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impediments to progress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Previous processes/structure/culture: command and control - hard habit to break&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project manager telling people what to do and when to do it by - this is bad management; it has an impact on people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want self-organizing teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Previously, black box development: low visibility during the project process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For Scrum, everything needs to be transparent, frequently inspect outcomes, adapt as we go - can't have a postmortem after everything's done, need to do that every day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hero developers who go off and solve problems heroically aren't compatible with Scrum&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Previously, developmental silos - departments based on function, these have been removed, but people still want to exist within their old silos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People want to work on multiple projects like they used to, rather than working on a single project in a dedicated manner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Previously, traditional line management: where you stack up in the line doesn't matter now, this was a big change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engineering practices (specifically quality) - big issue; Scrum is a wrapper for your existing engineering practices, doesn't say anything about testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scrum assumes your engineering practices are great, or you'll make them great quickly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can say &quot;we're going to do Scrum&quot; but old habits die hard - focusing on what &quot;done&quot; means and providing a deliverable at the end of each sprint, have to deliver quality too-- have to go live successfully&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Want to deliver &quot;potentially shippable code&quot; at the end of each session - have to have a testing environment that's representative of live environment; been bitten by differences in configuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything has to be identical in the test environment (just with a scaled down number of servers) - same data center, same network issues, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard to bite the bullet on the costs involved in building a testing environment, but it's important&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard to simulate kinds of traffic you get in production - plus, have to keep track of session cookies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Form fields can hurt you - replaying post requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cron jobs that run all the time - cron jobs can stack up and site starts to decay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Migration of real-time data: code changes are easier to migrate than content changes, what's the process for moving bits of content from development to production?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When there's content you need to work on for a while before it goes live, work on the live servers but make sure end-users can't see it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can use the unpublished flag on a Drupal node to do that; use &quot;views&quot; to see everything unpublished in sports category&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a small team, that's a reasonable solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For bigger organizations with a lot of people working together, use &quot;Workflow&quot; module - nodes step through a series of states&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it's a business requirement that content has to start off on staging servers and only then push to live, use module &quot;Deploy&quot; - push-button way to push nodes and their dependencies-- users, taxonomy terms, etc-- to another environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical reason for using external searching - why use SOLR at all? What about Drupal search?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drupal 6 is better than previous search mechanisms, but falls apart at a certain scale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slow queries, sub-optimal results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of non-Drupal people have worked on Apache SOLR, Drupal has integrated it well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-hosting, or with Acquia - if you have the talent to run Java apps in your data center and keep it running, self-hosting is a great idea; will reduce latency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of us are struggling to keep PHP/MySQL up as it is, this is where Acquia comes in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acquia service is pretty much plug-and-play&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built-in search doesn't come with facets; can add on facets with the &quot;Faceted Search&quot; module&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SOLR is an enterprise search system; used by Netflix, Expedia, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Could you use Views instead of facets?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's a lot of overlap there, and different possible approaches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full-text searches need SOLR rather than Views&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of the wins you've had with Scrum/Drupal, and some weaknesses
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wins by development teams - prefer this way of working, where business people are only concerned with relative priority of requirements, have no say in how long it takes to implement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Product owners prioritize &quot;stories&quot;, developers size those stories relative to each other, rather than in hours of effort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stops the cycle of cutting corners on quality in order to get it done in a shorter timeframe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can't get productivity gains w/o changing the way you work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Product owners need to be involved, can't change requirements mid-sprint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have &quot;working agreements&quot; - a kind of social contract&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scrum isn't a prescription - you can pick and choose the parts that you want that meet your organization's needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specific processes layered on top of simple framework of transparency, working together, and adapting to testing results, can vary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When will the Economist be fully on Drupal?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Description says &quot;this month&quot; - that was the plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People paying the bills get to make decisions; is it most important for us to go all-Drupal ASAP, or extend functionality of site to be competitive?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recent decision was for the latter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't know when&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>
