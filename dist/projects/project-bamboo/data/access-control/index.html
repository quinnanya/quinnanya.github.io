<p>"The second problem is the inability or difficulty for researchers to access audiovisual records related to Performing Arts. These are, in most cases, viewable only at the institution that houses them. Even when one is able to view the material, copying for later re-examination is often impossible due to copyright issues. Additionally, quoting is always done indirectly in written form, and is inevitably vague as it is impractical to reference timecode on a tape that one doesn't possess. We can certainly affirm that, compared to other fields in the Humanities, and even more so if compared to research in science, the quality of research in Performing Arts is hampered by the general difficulty in accessing records."

<p>"Not only tech problems, but process problems that stop flow of information. Copyright: legal barriers, and our own processes put on top of legal barriers. Don't have good processes for differentiating between research requests for data, and publication requests for data. Have to think about this and work through it. Need to streamline process for pub rights. Libraries beginning to offer services to help researchers w/ copyright issues. Help lower barriers by working w/ owners of licensed content. Not everyone's as generous as JSTOR in sharing data w/ researchers. Developing new language for license agreements to streamline process. Lib has a good community method for doing this work w/ licensed data. PB can help w/ this by creating community of support w/in libraries. Providing discussion forums, policy and best practices."
