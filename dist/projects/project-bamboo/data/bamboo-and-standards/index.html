<p>"3 types of standards. 1) Easiest to pin down are "technical/plumbing standards. have to exist for any practical activity to take place, wouldn't want to intervene in those (Bamboo could make an identification which standards make sense). Doesn't affect methodological consideration; Humanities scholars might not want to comment on TCP/IP. 2) Middle domain of technical standards with methodological impact: TEI, EAD. consequences and benefits for some kind of agreement, but Bamboo might not have a role in developing or requiring those. 3) Domain of practices, standards (workflow, project management) which are very domain specific. standards for peer review, etc. In those areas, PB has even less role to play in terms of requirements, but a strong role for awareness helping people get a grip on those standards, how to make use of them.

<p>"Risks: Possibility that the more PB identifies itself with certain standards, more risk of alienation/pushback from the community where there's likes/dislikes.

<p>"Rewards: Credibility for work Bamboo does. Interoperability. Facilitating the work of newcomers - prevents people from having to start from scratch. Critical mass. Longevity - standards might tend to lead to greater longevity of data involved. What was in/out of scope? Bamboo has a strong role to play in raising awareness ,value of using certain specifications. Value in adopting specific standards only in "plumbing standards". Liasoning with standards bodies, jointly developed "Bamboo-specific" reflections of their standards."

<p>"There was some discussion of whether the name should include a qualifier such as "recommended" to soften the impact of "standards". In the final analysis we agreed (but not decisively) to leave this out. The group substituted "best practices" for "specifications" because the domain of best practices seemed significant for Bamboo's community (and for the kinds of risks and rewards the group had identified) whereas "specifications" seemed vaguer than "standards" and yet equally technical, not a useful amplification."

<p>"In addition to providing a URL to a human-readable splash page for each resource held, Bamboo content partners should provide persistent URLs for representation(s) of each resource (and potentially resource components) amenable to analysis, manipulation, re-use, re-purposing by scholarly tools and services. Such URLs should either be disseminated in accord with community standards and best practices (e.g., ATOM, OAI-ORE, ...) or should be made visible from splash pages such that automated resource URL brokering services can "discover" these additional URLs through spidering and associate them as added metadata with base resource. Bamboo could build such a URL brokering service for actionable URLs that would facilitate access by scholarly tools to, in this instance, high-res representation of digital image resources. Personal collection / personal library management tools (e.g., Zotero) should be able to ingest and disseminate not only descriptive metadata about resources of interest, but also metadata about associated components and representations of a resource that a scholar might want to submit to a tool in order to analyze, manipulate, etc. For Zotero, the ingest part might be accomplish through implementation of translators (as in this illustration). These could be developed and promulgated by Bamboo. Tools designed to facilitate scholarly interaction with digital resources should be able to ingest digital resources via URL. Tools should provide human and machine interfaces consistent with Web architecture priniciples -- e.g., so users can interact with tools via their Web browsers. Tools should generate Web-referenceable and preservable representation(s) of output -- i.e., so that tool output can be ingested into repositories and so become digital resources in their own right."

<p>"Do technologists at your institution believe that linkage of technical materials (service models, service contracts, service endpoints where implementations are actually deployed) to expressions of workflow, procedure, and objects-of-interest as articulated by scholarship-oriented members of Bamboo's community will improve implementations, uptake, or both? Discussions here seem to indicate that they are an important audience. Information from the <span class="glossary-term" title="The Atlas was a somewhat amorphous piece of the Bamboo Implementation Plan. The long-term vision Bamboo Program Document stated that the Atlas would record and deliver community input (Scholarly Narratives, Tool examples, Content/Resource examples, Service Families, community-contributed references to information outside the formal bounds of Bamboo, etc.) in easily updated, linked, annotatable forms that may be mixed, matched, categorized, and re-categorized."><abbr title="The Atlas was a somewhat amorphous piece of the Bamboo Implementation Plan.

<p>"Notion of services and being able to deploy them - question of specifications, what are we providing to facilitate that, what's coming out of institutions, how do you do replications, other scenarios that move services around, etc. Easy to express ideas, but difficult to do because there's so much diversity involved.

<p>"One year:<br />
-Assimilate content and interoperability requirements determined through Bamboo assessment and service definition efforts.<br />
-Synthesize published assessments and surveys of relevant content providers and forge mutually beneficial partnerships that will commit to interoperability development and testing<br />
-Explore Shibboleth as a technical solution to authentication across Bamboo content provider partners"<br />
Two years:<br />
-Produce multiple proof-of-concept builds for support of higher impact use cases (determined by assessment and requirements process), involving multiple data types<br />
-Produce Shib-based authentication method as proof-of-concept. If successful, consider setting a requirement for institutions to join InCommon to be eligible for use of Bamboo API services<br />
-Model scaled-out interoperability architectures (e.g., grid model)<br />
-Set initial requirements for institutions to be open to the Bamboo "pipeline"" (<span class="glossary-term" title="Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls."><abbr title="Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.">W4</abbr></span> Action Plan - 4.5 Content Interoperability Partnerships)</p>
<p>"Focus here was on PB's role in interoperability piece and dependency on partners. Even discovery layer, search services. Urge to draw distinction where PB would NOT provide its efforts re: content discovery/access. Mini-mission statement: focus on model that will reduce friction, lower barriers to content access, transport access to content/data in ways that scholars need them. Use synthesis, etc. Expected qualities re: standards, issues, formats. Useful discussion re: rights and access control - important as we move forward. This is a point of friction re: multi-institutional access."
