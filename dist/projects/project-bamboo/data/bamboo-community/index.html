&lt;p&gt;&quot;For every connection w/ Bamboo, because relationship developed into this workshop. We're trying to solve the &quot;pub problem&quot; - we have a community now, and we're all in the big pub sharing ideas, and since we're in the pub we can talk to each other and over a virtual beer we can make a connection. Work of working groups/program staff/ extended community w/ Bamboo-- lots of power/ideas/possibilities here.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Introductory Remarks, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Chad J. Kainz, Senior Director for Academic Technologies in Networking Services &amp; Information Technologies at the University of Chicago (later, Asst. Chief IT Officer and Executive Director, Campus &amp; Academic Services in IT Services) was a Co-Director and subsequently Principal Investigator for the Bamboo Planning Project.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Chad J.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;What we're proposing - over 7-10 years, building on discussion metaphor and suggesting there's a fundamental role for PB to play in terms of continuing conversation around intersection of schol. practice around A, H, and interpretive Social Science. Elements to allow people across different universities/communities to find each other, understand what's possible, simple ways to connect w/ other resources, publish information, etc.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Overview of &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The Bamboo Program Document (drafts published March-April 2009) was a an outline for a possible 7-10 year vision for the Bamboo Community, discussed at Workshop 4.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;The Bamboo Program Document (drafts published March-April 2009) was a an outline for a possible 7-10 year vision for the Bamboo Community, discussed at Workshop 4.&quot;&gt;Program Document&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Selection problem: need to select tools, worried about how to make that selection fairly. How to select tools we'll bring together, maintain focus of this community. Probable that we can't address everyone needs in first pass. How to keep people engaged, not lose that segment of the community. Dependencies - relationships: need relationships w/ projects and faculty we're trying to help.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Action Plan - 4.4 Tool and Application Alignment Partnerships, discussion)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;[Education group] also talked abut this; need involvement as beta testers, working w/ scholarly narratives, pulling in faculty, talking specifically abut assignments, getting students involved, educating faculty.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Action Plan - 4.4 Tool and Application Alignment Partnerships, discussion)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Feedback proces: Testing, feedback, redesign, Connects back to iterative design&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; - Guiding Principles for Bamboo, Group 1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;PB needs in the first year to establish a core of tools, etc as a demonstration. Hum scholars need to be integrated into development. In short range: work w/ people already involved in something digital; long range - get many more humanists involved. &quot;Bamboo Charter&quot; - document that needs to address needs and points of view explicitly of different audiences - &quot;unusual suspects&quot;, general suspects, chairs/deans/admins/CIO.&quot;  (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; - Guiding Principles for Bamboo, Group 2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Human element, knitting together different kinds of work, ways Bamboo can reach out and connect, but also how we can build and nurture community from within. Important area - &quot;if you'd like to come to an area where you can have interesting and wacky discussions, come this afternoon!&quot;&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;W5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Overview: &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The section of the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal that addressed what Bamboo would do (scholarly networking, atlas, services platform, community).

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Community section as having a narrow jurisdiction - what has to happen to run some of the ongoing workshops we'd hold in implementation phase, what has to happen to develop/support next generation of wiki tool, a lot of broader sense of community (people w/o even formal role of PB) is happening in &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The Atlas was a somewhat amorphous piece of the Bamboo Implementation Plan.

There's people doing leadership/development. 671 people on the wiki, not that many in this room. There's an extended community of individuals and institutions; this is &quot;Our Community&quot;. Efforts/work in bringing in new ideas, sharing concepts, connecting w/ projects, sharing resources - this is human connection above that; from that, we define specific pieces that we might want to develop/build to support the greater good; this is where we get into governance, project moving forward in different areas. We set off to be a tech project; ended up with a set of tech projects AND a group of individuals that have come together to solve problems with or without tech.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;W5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Overview: &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The section of the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal that addressed what Bamboo would do (scholarly networking, atlas, services platform, community).

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Virtual collaboration piece - how does scholarly networking interface w/ community, w/ all the other pieces? If the community is about expressing Bamboo, advocating for particular approaches, best practices, connecting, collaborating, continuing community, sharing ideas/resources/etc, then virtual environment should support our activities/tools/etc. Current set of tools is probably inadequate for moving forward. We just have to do this, not the kind of thing we start in January and hopefully it's done by following January - kind of useless that way. Should look at demonstrator, integrate community into governance, and between now and December, launch demonstrator that does requirements analysis, looks at what we need to be doing to get the right capabilities for collaboration, then extend Bamboo beyond the boundaries of this community. Move forward with an implementation in that demonstrator, to have a 0.9 version around December. So it's ready for January.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;W5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Report Out: &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The section of the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal that addressed what Bamboo would do (scholarly networking, atlas, services platform, community).

A call for humanists to get out there and get involved. Spectrum of requirements analysis can be a two-way communication. How things connect back. Humanists can get involved at different levels, too. Scholars SHOULD be concerned about low-level design; you'd better know how the stemming is being done. Bringing out phrase &quot;community design&quot;. Community design of shared cyberinfrastructure.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;W5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, blog report on &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The Atlas was a somewhat amorphous piece of the Bamboo Implementation Plan.

&lt;p&gt;Q: &quot;I think that's where the issue of advocacy becomes rather important; community of Bamboo relates to communities that exist in local areas. Those communities in local areas need to link design and engineering with IT with researchers. That's what needs to be done at the local level for successful projects. Bamboo wants to have a structure that facilitates collaboration in local areas, feeds into it; advocacy: those teams we're talking about are almost normal in the context of the sciences, to the extent that if they're developing a major project, can say &quot;in this case, we want a film editing person working with us, etc&quot; can go to school of art, bring them in. They have the resources to have a mixed community necessary to achieve objectives. They'll stretch into the humanities to do that. We want to reverse that project, with putting humanities at the center. Will link into community of people locally, but we at Bamboo can show models for how that can work effectively for the Humanities. And then create kind of resources in long term that will facilitate that.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;W5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, blog report on &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The Atlas was a somewhat amorphous piece of the Bamboo Implementation Plan.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Almost everyone wants to eliminate Bamboo Community into Section 5 [of &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The Bamboo Implementation Proposal (revisions published May-August 2009) was intended to be submitted to Mellon's RIT program for funding, until RIT folded in December 2009.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;The Bamboo Implementation Proposal (revisions published May-August 2009) was intended to be submitted to Mellon's RIT program for funding, until RIT folded in December 2009.&quot;&gt;BIP&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Discussion Draft v0.5].&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;W5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Preliminary Vote: &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The section of the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal that addressed what Bamboo would do (scholarly networking, atlas, services platform, community).

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We may want to call out specific leadership to make sure right things are moving forward, might want to consider that for community. Will have to wrangle a lot of &quot;stuff&quot; to coordinate things and keep it together. Shift of scholarly networking to UI-focused entity: one problem is coordinating activity across units. Executive committee: leaders of different working groups, executive director, &quot;Bamboo office&quot;, and a program manager who is responsible for wrangling all the activity to keep it on target/path/message, all the &quot;on's&quot;. Need to make sure that on proposals submitted, Bamboo continues to deliver on what it's promised. Focus on program-related duties; how does services platform and work of services platform folks interact w/ other services activities.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;W5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Preliminary Vote: &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The section of the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal that addressed what Bamboo would do (scholarly networking, atlas, services platform, community).

&lt;p&gt;&quot;A few years out, idea that a group of scholars could get together an suggest they want the possibility of bringing together repositories, and curating content with certain tools, etc - that activity, I don't see where that happens.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;W5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Open Discussion: Governance, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~wnm/&quot;&gt;Worthy Martin&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We had an issue about the logical ordering of proposal, people were reacting to splitting things out, but uniformly recognition of power of working together as community. As we reflect on feedback here, we want to build that in, but 5-7 people feel that making [community] a &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Major Areas of Work; the section of the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal that addressed what Bamboo would do (scholarly networking, atlas, services platform, community). Discussed at workshop 5.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Major Areas of Work; the section of the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal that addressed what Bamboo would do (scholarly networking, atlas, services platform, community). Discussed at workshop 5.&quot;&gt;MAoW&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; muddied the waters. Need to figure out a way to make proposal logically consistent, but have community appear in multiple dimensions.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;W5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Open Discussion: Bamboo Community, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;David Greenbaum, Director of Data Services at the University of California, Berkeley, was a Co-Director of the Bamboo Planning Project.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;David Greenbaum, Director of Data Services at the University of California, Berkeley, was a Co-Director of the Bamboo Planning Project.&quot;&gt;David Greenbaum&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worthy Martin: &quot;What happened to [community] in scholarly networking section? Current suggestion to go to section 5 [of &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The Bamboo Implementation Proposal (revisions published May-August 2009) was intended to be submitted to Mellon's RIT program for funding, until RIT folded in December 2009.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;The Bamboo Implementation Proposal (revisions published May-August 2009) was intended to be submitted to Mellon's RIT program for funding, until RIT folded in December 2009.&quot;&gt;BIP&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Discussion Draft v0.5] - okay, but it's crucial part of scholarly networking part. Permeates everything, should be coming up all over the place, seems to have been taken out of scholarly network; this is troublesome.&quot; &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;David Greenbaum, Director of Data Services at the University of California, Berkeley, was a Co-Director of the Bamboo Planning Project.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;David Greenbaum, Director of Data Services at the University of California, Berkeley, was a Co-Director of the Bamboo Planning Project.&quot;&gt;David Greenbaum&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: &quot;One thing we heard on that front, how we look at revised scholarly networking/atlas - doing right conjoining so people/community/connection part gets instantiated in that work along with other sustaining the community in section 5.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;W5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Open Discussion: Bamboo Community, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;David Greenbaum, Director of Data Services at the University of California, Berkeley, was a Co-Director of the Bamboo Planning Project.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;David Greenbaum, Director of Data Services at the University of California, Berkeley, was a Co-Director of the Bamboo Planning Project.&quot;&gt;David Greenbaum&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Important to capture this as part of the story of the planning process. Interesting observation looking at this project, in conversations, we applied for an internal institutional grant, got funding to come do this-- these stories we need. Much more community than we ever imagined. If you have a story saying that you could participate for doing something cool, demonstrators opened up new opportunities, enabled conversations, triggered new ways of thinking, etc. - we need these stories. Helps re-enforce community case for PB, not just technology. Really makes a point about how important working together is, what we view as potential; not just stuff, but connections/opportunities that OUR social networking has enabled.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;W5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Open Discussion: Bamboo Community, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Chad J.
