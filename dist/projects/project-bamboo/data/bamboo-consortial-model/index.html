&lt;p&gt;&quot;Everything hinges on what is going on here; a big group? small core? What's PB going to do? If it's building, go small. If community, go big. What is the nature of the project?

In both cases, what's being talked about is a principle that can't be fully fleshed out because we don't have info about other aspects of decision making. A smaller group will think about the notes and come up with some more fully fleshed out ideas; would be good if two alternatives proposed could be fleshed out as scenarios along with full consequences - some things can't be supported if we pick one or another.

Some people have multiple hats as members of organizations; &quot;for the sake of Bamboo, I'm with this organization, but I may sometimes represent institution if necessary&quot;. Can participate in PB in a focused fashion.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;How idea of partners comes in - 3-6 (at least 3 because of 3 layers). Sit on some sort of leadership thing (&quot;the Board&quot;). Each partner represents the layer it's leading, reflecting what's coming from that layer. Big Bamboo Direction, what we should be doing as a large organization. Need a Bamboo &quot;Office&quot; - there's a lot to running this, it's a lot to manage/maintain. Institution that administers the business side, deals with large community activity coordination work, but doesn't lead any of the layers. An institution not buried by leading something else - a balance across the different layers. Fills role of neutral party, chairs the &quot;Board&quot;, acts as the &quot;executive director&quot;.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are fully consortial institution-- faculties drawn from various institutions. We had to develop complicated consortial model. Codify that consortial model extremely carefully - a group of people in this room are the &quot;original gangsters&quot; - they'll be gone someday, and people lose sense of connection to what started this. People come in at the community layer level and not be clear about partners/leadership team. Need a doc we can all use that's fairly clear.

Agile - need to move planning one down, so what planners do is get builders very close in sticking to labs and stuff like that, rapid and iterative development.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Concern about early vs late adopters - some institutions which can't contribute now but could contribute during build phase; how do you value input of early/late adopters, balancing incentives of helping out in the beginning vs need to grow a community&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Introduce element of time - one of concerns about cons[ortial] model, it's very elaborate, centralization about it; given discussions of limited resources, it seems there's implicit assumption that there's a limited timeframe in which PB has to get something done. This is backwards - we'll end up with a more simplified model in reality. Opening discussion of this kind of model will run risk of calcifying view of what PB should be rather than allowing qualities to emerge more organically. If we set our sights within limits of resources, focus on small, clearly defined goals to begin with, this is how you earn right to build towards that kind of model. Also solves question of how to sell to institutions - we've achieved these four small things rather than tackling a large thing. Tempting to go for the home run, but without undercutting our own potential, doing something achievable in the beginning will lead up to greater success&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Now: In this new environment, what's the best work for us? One of important goals, as we develop program document, continue to flesh out 7-10 year issues. Turn this to a 3-year focus.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;No better way to actually have it clear that we ant to be a partner, than to be a partner. Short timeframe - could shift emphasis on building to a small group of people (heads down, get it done). But can't lose overall community design/development/outreach, including notion of professional development/outreach that we articulated early on. Make sure we create opportunities for contribution for non-build institutions. Learn from mistakes and successes (our own, others'). More visible connections to what's gone before.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; - Guiding Principles for Bamboo, Group 5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Need to see sensible and useful things coming out of it. Iterative processes, rapid testing; working towards the real thing. Collaboration is key.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Organization that helps rally institutional resources to deliver, necessary to provide value in some way. Making it more affordable, by spreading cost across institutions. Number of ways to organize this at the moment. I regret I still don't know what PB is.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; - Guiding Principles for Bamboo, Group 7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'd like to say that it is important in year1/2 to think about strategic connection of PB with certain their consortia, initiatives and appropriate Societies – as a way to quickly add value, without duplication of effort – and to address the question &quot;why do we need another consortium now and I thought that &quot;X&quot; already did this , or could do this&quot;, in a time of very tight resources and focusing of resources for all.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; - Guiding Principles for Bamboo, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.educause.edu/Community/MemDir/Profiles/ThomasJKnab/47798&quot;&gt;Tom Knab&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Very diverse community, we have to respect that. We work together, but bring many different perspectives. How do we come to agreement? None of the charts have everyone agreeing on the same thing? Need to finds some way of making decisions, finding some kind of consensus. There'll be trade-offs on the way, but we're all striving for the common good. This should lead to advancements in projects/individual research/etc. Integrating things we could benefit from into different projects. Evolve as needs and interests change. Today what we're doing seems to work, but in 5 years it may be different, and PB has to recognize that things will change and we'll have to adapt.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The Bamboo Program Document (drafts published March-April 2009) was a an outline for a possible 7-10 year vision for the Bamboo Community, discussed at Workshop 4.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;The Bamboo Program Document (drafts published March-April 2009) was a an outline for a possible 7-10 year vision for the Bamboo Community, discussed at Workshop 4.&quot;&gt;Program Document&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Section 5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;&quot;Exploration lab&quot; - what is it? Concept of lab resonated w/ members of leaderships council. Place with interesting experimentation. Where people solve problems at large scale/small scale. Cluster around getting something done. Think about work that needs to be done in PB as a collection of labs. Not a grand, big project of developing something like Kuali. New possibilities, existing possibilities for research/scholarship/learning, etc. Cluster around particular areas of common interest; promoting idea of innovation; if you want something done, you work towards that goal. By keeping activity in smaller clusters, you can react more quickly to particular problems. For any of this to work, there has to be some structured activity/effort. Focus on getting things done: &quot;let's get started with something!&quot; Gotta figure out what the something is.&quot;  (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The Bamboo Program Document (drafts published March-April 2009) was a an outline for a possible 7-10 year vision for the Bamboo Community, discussed at Workshop 4.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;The Bamboo Program Document (drafts published March-April 2009) was a an outline for a possible 7-10 year vision for the Bamboo Community, discussed at Workshop 4.&quot;&gt;Program Document&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Section 5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There's also a reality of administrative overhead we have to deal with to get through funding stage, etc. Don't want to wait on BAMBOO to make a big decision - that slows everybody down. Reducing the amount of administrative overhead necessary. Get to the point of getting stuff done. Community component - anyone who's interested in what PB is doing. Members are people who are coordinating activity at own institutions or here, undertaking/promoting projects, as they evolve they're an instantiation of labs. Shaping/refining scope/direction of PB. Working w/ other organizations in PB-wide initiatives. There's much inside the membership box - didn't want to over think the problem. Certain levels of leadership like we talked about before.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The Bamboo Program Document (drafts published March-April 2009) was a an outline for a possible 7-10 year vision for the Bamboo Community, discussed at Workshop 4.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;The Bamboo Program Document (drafts published March-April 2009) was a an outline for a possible 7-10 year vision for the Bamboo Community, discussed at Workshop 4.&quot;&gt;Program Document&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Section 5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Formal liaison. Diversity - range of people involved with Bamboo. You and your organizations know this kind of stuff in your own local organizations, how paperwork works - can serve as liaison. Notion of how can we make sure we get things done - not trying to move 42 institutions in one direction. Maybe people at one table think we need one thing, others sort of go along with it, but not everyone has to participate.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The Bamboo Program Document (drafts published March-April 2009) was a an outline for a possible 7-10 year vision for the Bamboo Community, discussed at Workshop 4.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;The Bamboo Program Document (drafts published March-April 2009) was a an outline for a possible 7-10 year vision for the Bamboo Community, discussed at Workshop 4.&quot;&gt;Program Document&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Section 5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: &quot;Think of labs as playground, exploration ground for faculty to explore digital humanities projects. But central coordination/duplication of exploration - driven from a more technical POV; building up technical projects, so less a place for faculty. What is the primary purpose?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
A: &quot;Keep pushing boundaries, keep pushing innovation. Can we extend the work that's going on? Google Labs - access to services that may or may not be officially supported services, but it's something you can try. Where this breaks down might be extending it to the oversight level of entire project. Larger coordination activities might need to be classified as something else.

So why would they go to PB to explore, except there's some resources there that make it more possible? Is that the case? Do you envision having resources there?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We need to put this together and see what happens; governance needed to get us off the ground isn't the same as the &quot;ring&quot; governance of the long term.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Explore is built into very fabric of PB. Fully articulated version of that won't be there. But in the beginning it wouldn't be a bad idea to have a few PB sanctioned labs doing fundamental exploration. Then we get to resource issues - labor isn't free, but you're not a funding agency. Want to elicit cost sharing, but if PB had incubator fund for first year, to help labs form (w/ understanding that labs &quot;home&quot; would have at least one-to-one matching) - could lead to sustainable model.&quot;   (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The Bamboo Program Document (drafts published March-April 2009) was a an outline for a possible 7-10 year vision for the Bamboo Community, discussed at Workshop 4.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;The Bamboo Program Document (drafts published March-April 2009) was a an outline for a possible 7-10 year vision for the Bamboo Community, discussed at Workshop 4.&quot;&gt;Program Document&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Section 5, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mith.umd.edu/mithstaff/&quot;&gt;Neil Fraistat&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mary Jacobus remarked that a shadow governance model is the economy and resource availability.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Structure is hard and expensive. This level of structure is 7-10 year plan. Overkill for 1 year.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;A lot of this structure is cart before the horse. Hard to evaluate structure w/o knowing what work is. What projects is it supporting? Can't build such a structure who are motivated to explore/build on abstract projects. PROJECTS are the key.

Need a light structure that provides governance for bringing people together to work together on projects they already have self-interest to work on. Focus on things that build common infrastructure.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Table Discussion of Section 5, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linkedin.com/in/duffygillman&quot;&gt;Duffy Gillman&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Distinction between governance and economics of membership. Early on, might want it to be free so we could use the wider landscape. Need a lot of people using it? Don't charge membership. May need different models for different work objects. Governing social networking might be different than services. Continuum with membership and communities - not discrete&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Table Discussion of Section 5, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linkedin.com/in/timothybabbitt&quot;&gt;Tim Babbit&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Apache model offers something worth looking at. Large organization but still has a good reputation after 10 years. Focus on the social - incubation of projects, graduating when has certain purity, open to all but certain privileges on merit. Meritocracy. This is a model we could imitate; $300,000 dollars/yr. If circumstances are so dire, inclined to rethink some of the plans - work out what we might get started doing there. Assume money won't be there, but use what's left of planning grant to get a cooperative organization off the ground.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Table Discussion of Section 5, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.caret.cam.ac.uk/page/john-norman&quot;&gt;John Norman&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Much of table's focus was re: what this might look like on the ground. What's the real distinction between member and community? Comes down to quantification of contributions, how is participation measured. Longitudinal commitment might have relevance - contribution over a period of years has a value beyond each single year's value (1000 dollars a year for five years has an equal value to a one year commitment of 5000 dollars). Digital Library Federation is a model of an organization that has a fee, and puts money toward projects that demonstrate compliance with the DLF's standards. What does &quot;Bamboo will coordinate&quot; really mean? Is there a Bamboo-funded Project Manager.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Table Discussion of Section 5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a community-driven effort; some of the greatest value comes from linking together and building sustainable structure for different kinds of talents. Also means, from the start, understanding from different institutions what they can commit. From the start, trying to tackle sustainability.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;W5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Overview: &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The section of the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal that addressed what Bamboo would do (scholarly networking, atlas, services platform, community).

Discussed at workshop 5.&quot;&gt;Major Areas of Work&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;At some level, things have to connect together. At least two lead institutions associated w/ each working group that would connect in with Bamboo. Why 2? Based on our experience - huge benefit of working between Chicago and Berkeley - trading perspectives, bringing different ideas together. If there's a situation where an institution can no longer participate, entire work of working group won't come to a screeching halt. Leadership in a working group - more than managing mailing list, but trying to shape/guide working group. How it proceeds re: scope, does all the &quot;right&quot; things. That's a serious investment.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;W5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Open Discussion: Governance)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ongoing dialog/connections w/ Clarin, DARIAH. Responsibility through executive committee to make sure Bamboo connects with that. Type of work that needs to be done, materials people want to use, etc, are not bound by own institutions/connections. All trying to use materials that are used globally. Taking into account the world, not niche, in which we live. The way the project has been working thus far: David and I and Rich have been filling this role so far. Recommend things, take things, etc to leadership council. Questions and challenges we're facing. That is built into mechanism we've seen work well. Talk about over time, transition from Chicago-Berkeley leadership to an advisory board made up of representatives of projects moving forward. In executive committee, people worried about completing activities - short-medium term effort; strategic direction- where to go, what doing - greater than executive committee. Leadership council does the strategic vision. Leadership council made up of executive committee members. And other members at large. Need to have majority of faculty representation. Certain amount of executive committee, project leadership, but most of it comes from community. &quot;in 4 years what should we be doing?&quot; Provides advisory board function with gearing towards not technical advice, but strategic advice around where scholarship is going, what we should be doing.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;W5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Open Discussion: Governance)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In each of working group areas, explore/plan/build component. Executive Committee-- plan component. Leadership committee - high-level explore/plan. Where a bit of the community not being a working group anymore (this is a challenge for us to draft with your input) in section 5 - strong explore component in what was formerly community, that informs the rest of the work.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;W5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Open Discussion: Governance)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;2 things that play here - going to go to &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The Bamboo Planning Project received funding from the Andrew W.

But there's also the issue of the larger community that's going to be facilitated by that activity - need a different kind of organization for that.

May have a number of &quot;principal investigators&quot;. People in big leadership role may need to be represented appropriately in executive committee and leadership council. Right now, we have formal PIs + representatives from other parts of institution that are fundamentally important. Want to move work forward and get it done, but have a kind of openness and inclusiveness that allows guidance from broader community, exploring other projects. Trying to get that balance - we have requirements for year 1-2 building, and evolving more long-term.&quot; Kaylea Champion: &quot;As I see member institutions expressing/steering/driving/working with project is entirely through working group; certain working group members are also members of leadership council. Is that too much to ask, esp for faculty members?&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;W5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Open Discussion: Governance)&lt;/p&gt;
