        <p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Not much time to discuss second question - what are the new technologies elsewhere?

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Concept of standards; instead of establishing standards, establish self-consciousness about standards. Create a system of peer review for standards and services.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Clearinghouse for what's happening in all these disciplines. Is the term &quot;advocacy&quot; appropriate? A lot of the deans don't know what's happening in all these fields; PB could be the place to go to keep up with what's happening. We could represent that with visualizations (use our own technologies) - could be very constructive.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Role for PB as a clearinghouse for resources - more effective, less tyrannical. Provide information- those who want to advocate more forcefully can then use that info as they see fit. Scholarly networks might come into play; clearinghouse could consist of information, also statements of principle - these could have PB achieve a more transformative impact; shouldn't just be neutral.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;As a leader in this field, want to be a provider of information. Not pushing specific recommendations, but providing certain models that various groups have adopted, available for others to see.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;be a clearinghouse, make this more about Bamboo as a clearinghouse of information and resources - encompasses elements of all the groups&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Practical application / how can we lead by example, what would we need to do to make that happen (this is the clearing-house and best-practices role). A part of this working group could be charged with creating a kind of top layer, to give access to information about best practices, standards, demonstrations - gathering from or pointing to other working groups.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Scope: project in this area could be creating an active clearinghouse for identifying, collecting, disseminating best practices in DH; respect idea that there are profound differences between what different humanities disciplines do&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki. Participants suggested questions and issues for each Direction, and formed groups to delve further into their chosen Direction, including what aspects are within the scope of Project Bamboo, what Demonstrators would be helpful, and what the plan should be for the working group.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Priorities: Address how to develop templates for matters like best training practices, how universities could report on their digital projects, what worked, didn't, etc; report template for clearinghouse.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki. Participants suggested questions and issues for each Direction, and formed groups to delve further into their chosen Direction, including what aspects are within the scope of Project Bamboo, what Demonstrators would be helpful, and what the plan should be for the working group.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Can Bamboo offer a clearinghouse for standards and help people make informed choices? The kinds of standards we were talking about were less technical - more vetting, peer review, etc. - can this be shaped towards best practices for applying standards?&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;PB's possible role as a clearinghouse for info about standards, existing precedents/projects/etc. Raising the level of awareness, avoid duplication. This info role was also a role that's being claimed by other groups which have an existing community focus. What would the relationship be? (Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations, etc). Bamboo could be a clearinghouse of clearinghouses - aggregate and make visible work of other groups; would require agreement on formats of information. Or, PB could work in partnership with one or more organizations - can we make you into the community expression/branch of this need that the group has articulated, but PB doesn't want to take on alone - conserve focus and allow it to put resources elsewhere.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Priorities/scope: Thinking for furthering collaboration/conversation in DH. Building a discovery/use layer that's comprised of a tool registry and content/resource registry.Expose things for discovery, talk about what they're built on. Making it really easy for registries to be used, building up use cases and case studies and stories contributed to by all the people involved (humanities scholars, librarians, IT) - get use case from all their perspectives. Finding out about things that didn't work too.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki. Participants suggested questions and issues for each Direction, and formed groups to delve further into their chosen Direction, including what aspects are within the scope of Project Bamboo, what Demonstrators would be helpful, and what the plan should be for the working group.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Thought about creating a repository in order to capture what's already out there (what we scoped out in the morning - a discovery and use layer). Clear needs for demonstrators: demonstrator wiki that would allow us to collect the items for the registry (tools, also could be tagged by the domain/activity/themes/degree of interoperability). Wiki would allow community to collect what's already out there. How can we cluster the themes that are already there, can integrate into use cases and list the kind of use cases people are doing with those tools? Demonstrator that would create a template for use cases and case studies&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Agreement in the group - very important to not only capture tools and available content, but also the workflow that's attached to those tools - what do people actually do with that? Can capture scholarly activity more precisely and define it by domain. How the tools connect to different scholarly activities. Demonstrators: template that will allow us to define the typical problem - not just a list of tools, but what are they trying to solve? Can they be reused, reconfigured in a specific scholarly process?&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Registry for discovery of tools/services/content. Need to identify what core services are needed - access to data, common services we can use to access text/multimedia.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Distribution/promotion of available digital content.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;MERLOT is not very useful. One has high hopes that you're going to get information, that you're going to get something you can use, but it's quite disappointing in the actual event. There are others to consider, will write a list. LOLA has good content, but not necessarily great categories ... it's in some respects a reaction to things like MERLOT. e.g., cnx.org for content connection ... interesting model ... spotty, but interesting conceptually, based on Creative Commons licenses.&quot; (Shared Services working group, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The Bamboo Program Document (drafts published March-April 2009) was a an outline for a possible 7-10 year vision for the Bamboo Community, discussed at Workshop 4.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;The Bamboo Program Document (drafts published March-April 2009) was a an outline for a possible 7-10 year vision for the Bamboo Community, discussed at Workshop 4.&quot;&gt;Program Document&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Sec 4 - Discussion Draft of 9 March 2009, 3/11/09 discussion notes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Do scholars at your institution think this this concept can provide value to them and others on their faculties? Not necessarily of transcendent value.  It may be of more value to the technology/support staff, or to people whose work life revolves around the digital. Value is about competition for time and attention. Is something worth the startup time? See discussion above about what humanists are really working on. A place where examples/comparanda are gathered will be accessible to a larger audience, certainly.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We also discussed the issue of some kind of peer review and expert review? Where does expertise live in this system.  How about curation? Amazon reviews are very useful, but that's because there are so many of them. What's to stop bad applications/solutions from being posted?

&lt;p&gt;&quot;One of the barriers keeping many scholars in the Humanities from fully exploiting digital resources in their teaching and research is a general lack of awareness of existing and developing digital collections that could serve their needs. Use is further hampered by a lack of awareness of effective ways to use this digital content.&quot; (Education working group, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/rauner/research/rauner_staff.html&quot;&gt;Jay Satterfield&lt;/a&gt;, 4/1/09)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In some cases, scholarly communities have stepped in to mine the internet and catalog digital collections that are of potential use to their constituencies. A good example of this is the American Institute of Physics, which regularly polls Special Collections repositories for new collections related to Physics (and even offers grant money to process and create access to Physics-related collections). The Polar Library Consortium is currently surveying its members for digital collections related to the polar regions, in order to promote those collections as a group.&quot; (Education working group, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/rauner/research/rauner_staff.html&quot;&gt;Jay Satterfield&lt;/a&gt;, 4/1/09)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Humanities is so diffuse, and potential research collections are so diverse, that one of Project Bamboo's potential contributions could be exploring and enacting methods for creating widespread awareness of existing and emerging digital collections. A labor-intensive method would be to create a catalog of digital collections relevant to the Humanities. This would require constant updating, and heavy staffing. A better method is to find ways to encourage all digital collection producers to advertise their collections in a social networking environment for humanities scholars. If there were a social networking environment for humanities scholars who have created solid profiles of their research and teaching interests, then a digital collection producer could create a profile for its collection that would alert potential users of its availability. Also, scholars could tag existing collections to alert people with similar interests to their availability and usefulness. People could add teaching guides or other interpretive content to the digital collections. Over time, a database of collections with tags could be built that could then be mined.&quot; (Education working group, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/rauner/research/rauner_staff.html&quot;&gt;Jay Satterfield&lt;/a&gt;, 4/1/09)&lt;/p&gt;

Become resources no one trusts because they're obviously out of date, unless someone's really responsible for maintaining it.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Took qualitative approach to PB concepts. Providing a front 'age that will create a certain amount of enthusiasm for Hum scholars who aren't involved. First year goal: related to syllabus project. Scalability - developing that kind of tool, making syllabi more digital enhanced/friendly. Dealing w/ more advanced projects in DigHum; demonstrating range within DigHum. Facilitating more meta-critical awareness of digital culture/schools. Very much enhanced what it means to Hum scholars in particular.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;1.	A complicated annotatable database&lt;br /&gt;
2.	Distillation of a survey of surveys&lt;br /&gt;
3.	There are in diverse places, partial pieces of the services atlas but they haven’t been brought together.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;this wants to be a nuanced and powerful knowledge base and it sits at the front of this whole tools area, but it doesn’t seem to be linked well enough to the Tools.&lt;br /&gt;
a.	The base objects in this nuanced database are the services, tools, applications, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
b.	The diagram shows it well but the text does not&lt;br /&gt;
c.	The atlas is a metadata repository for everything bamboo&lt;br /&gt;
i.	Not itself a cloud item necessary&lt;br /&gt;
ii.	In principle, create a data model and slap it up in FEDORA&lt;br /&gt;</p>
<ol>
<li>Make a SAKAI widget to pull back services&lt;br /&gt;
d.	Vetting: there is some notion that almost anything goes in, but some of the things will be given the bamboo seal of approval&lt;br /&gt;
Is it a set of RDF relationships—the idea of connecting up.  It has to be richly connected within itself (recipes to the services they use, for example, to narratives that use it, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;
a.	Users need to be able to edit the information.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Action Plan - 4.1 Services &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The Atlas was a somewhat amorphous piece of the Bamboo Implementation Plan.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Worthy—a further idea.  Scholarly narratives, recipes, atlas, implementations, tools and services in the cluster, there is also a different sets of diagrams with the Explore plan build consortium there is the notion that there is community design and if so, the atlas is at the heart of that design.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Can we imagine this being some kind of federated thing—yes.&lt;br /&gt;
a.	We have a tough enough time documenting what we did in the planning process and yet that is very valuable—are people going to put in what they are thinking about?&lt;br /&gt;
i.	If there was a wiki as a place where you can do your thinking and do the writing about it only once.&lt;br /&gt;
ii.	Bamboo as a kind of consortium is a place where resources can be brought to bear to do work for the community&lt;br /&gt;
iii.	Funding privileges the work and not the documentation&lt;br /&gt;
iv.	Perhaps part of the basic criteria for getting the bamboo stamp of approval is to document your project or your service, application, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
d.	A federated solution would allow this to be spread around.&lt;br /&gt;
i.	Put up a recipe and other people then document the parts (e.g. other people’s undocumented code).&lt;br /&gt;
ii.	One of the services in the service atlas is demonstrating how many people are interested in a certain thing.&lt;br /&gt;
iii.	Voting-not so good&lt;br /&gt;

It's going to get out of date. If we try to make a way of aggregating all info of interest, it's going to be incomplete, arbitrary, and out of date.
