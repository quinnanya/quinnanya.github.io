&lt;p&gt;&quot;what kind of shared and borrowed tools can we bring into the humanities?&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; accomplish=&quot;&quot; questions=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; regarding=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; accomplish=&quot;&quot; questions=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; regarding=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 1&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-B)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;we will need the industry to participate; going between nonprofit and for-profit areas: that is scary&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; accomplish=&quot;&quot; questions=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; regarding=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; accomplish=&quot;&quot; questions=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; regarding=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 1&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-B)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;are there universities that have hooked up with social entrepreneurs?  (making nonprofit things profitable); can you take a nonprofit edu org and say, how can we scale this beyond the original community and not lose the ethos/mission but make them profitable, to make them enormous and help them do good in enormous ways; i.e., an economic model that can sustain itself in the future&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; accomplish=&quot;&quot; questions=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; regarding=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; accomplish=&quot;&quot; questions=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; regarding=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 1&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-B)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Tools (e.g. Virage) that are too expensive to purchase.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Get M$ and Google interested. These companies will recognize it, make it industrial strength, and then fund and package it. Bamboo can also legitimize this pipeline. Bamboo should aim to build a data centric resource to be funded at a NSF level.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; accomplish=&quot;&quot; questions=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; regarding=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; accomplish=&quot;&quot; questions=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; regarding=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 1&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-F)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In development of tools that PB may produce, can tools be created for humanities scholars' purposes rather than having to make due with what's created in a commercial context.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; accomplish=&quot;&quot; questions=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; regarding=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; accomplish=&quot;&quot; questions=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; regarding=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 1&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1c&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-C)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Lots of tools we need can work for other disciplines-- interesting to collaborate and share, not stay limited at national level&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; accomplish=&quot;&quot; questions=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; regarding=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; accomplish=&quot;&quot; questions=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; regarding=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 1&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1c&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-E)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Humanities is about interpreting, it's not about transferring knowledge. If an institution is involved in teaching and learning, the old school is dissemination in lecture hall.  New school is open-ended on the web. Is teaching and learning necessarily in a closed environment? Knowledge transfer generally ends up referring to external agencies. Linking with the outside world is something foreign to the humanities, when science tends to link to commercial realms more often. Continuing education, or connections to external mechanisms, are more difficult in humanities.  What are the processes coming from the outside world that can welcome the humanities? How does industry respond to the humanities?&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Common and Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; common=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; that=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; emerged=&quot;&quot; from=&quot;&quot; your=&quot;&quot; exploration=&quot;&quot; of=&quot;&quot; scholarly=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; based=&quot;&quot; on=&quot;&quot; discussion=&quot;&quot; two=&quot;&quot; piqued=&quot;&quot; the=&quot;&quot; curiosity=&quot;&quot; those=&quot;&quot; at=&quot;&quot; table=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; uncommon=&quot;&quot; makes=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; and=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Common and Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; common=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; that=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; emerged=&quot;&quot; from=&quot;&quot; your=&quot;&quot; exploration=&quot;&quot; of=&quot;&quot; scholarly=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; based=&quot;&quot; on=&quot;&quot; discussion=&quot;&quot; two=&quot;&quot; piqued=&quot;&quot; the=&quot;&quot; curiosity=&quot;&quot; those=&quot;&quot; at=&quot;&quot; table=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; uncommon=&quot;&quot; makes=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; and=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 3&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1c&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-B)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Scholars have to build on commercial systems in particular ways. Amazon gives general user recommendations. We've had users saying &quot;we don't want social tagging, it's done by non-experts&quot; Social tagging has to be modified in ways that don't make money. &quot;If you guys were using MathML in your browsers, it'd be a lot easier.&quot; &gt; Mozilla did it, Microsoft said the community is too small, so forget it.&quot;&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Common and Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; common=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; that=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; emerged=&quot;&quot; from=&quot;&quot; your=&quot;&quot; exploration=&quot;&quot; of=&quot;&quot; scholarly=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; based=&quot;&quot; on=&quot;&quot; discussion=&quot;&quot; two=&quot;&quot; piqued=&quot;&quot; the=&quot;&quot; curiosity=&quot;&quot; those=&quot;&quot; at=&quot;&quot; table=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; uncommon=&quot;&quot; makes=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; and=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Common and Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; common=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; that=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; emerged=&quot;&quot; from=&quot;&quot; your=&quot;&quot; exploration=&quot;&quot; of=&quot;&quot; scholarly=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; based=&quot;&quot; on=&quot;&quot; discussion=&quot;&quot; two=&quot;&quot; piqued=&quot;&quot; the=&quot;&quot; curiosity=&quot;&quot; those=&quot;&quot; at=&quot;&quot; table=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; uncommon=&quot;&quot; makes=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; and=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 3&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1d&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-D)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;People who design technology are learning a great deal from these early versions. Speech recognition reveals things linguists didn't understand before. When Google figures out how to figure out what you're interested in, it'll have figured out a lot about thinking.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Model like Amazon S3 - get content-free infrastructure for tools, set up your chunk of a virtual server (pick tools and click) and virtual pie piece is cut out for you.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Commercial developers (Oxygen, as an example) are often happy, or proud that academic institutions use their tools. If Bamboo can encourage other projects along this line with other tools. True, but open-source software isn't free.  Often cheaper for programmers elsewhere to write the software which is cheaper model for software. We are dependent on these tools, so they need to be open-source and in our hands. We rely on these tools for projects without infrastructure to build on.  So, perhaps building a new infrastructure that is open-source. We are living in different time frames than commercial developers.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Opportunities for Bamboo: &quot; discuss=&quot;&quot; which=&quot;&quot; future=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; activities=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; think=&quot;&quot; would=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; best=&quot;&quot; supported=&quot;&quot; by=&quot;&quot; a=&quot;&quot; consortial=&quot;&quot; effort=&quot;&quot; like=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; and=&quot;&quot; explain=&quot;&quot; why.=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Opportunities for Bamboo: &quot; discuss=&quot;&quot; which=&quot;&quot; future=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; activities=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; think=&quot;&quot; would=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; best=&quot;&quot; supported=&quot;&quot; by=&quot;&quot; a=&quot;&quot; consortial=&quot;&quot; effort=&quot;&quot; like=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; and=&quot;&quot; explain=&quot;&quot; why.=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 7&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1c&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-B)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Can tools built to common standards coffer a compromise between commercial and open-source? Always an investment - no way to de-couple tools from standards in an effective way. True, sometimes the interface of certain tools require training that are beyond the scope of a projects. Return to a J-Stor for tools. A company like Oxygen has a better record for producing tools that are useful and sustainable, as opposed to Digital Humanitites Project. Should be careful not to be tied into particular commercial software. We haven't got a good track record for building useful open-source tools. But people have been building tools for themselves. We have to explore possibility of approaching open-source developers to make these tools more widely available and easier to use.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Q: Consortia: a couple consortia that were mentioned here during the workshop - Sakai and Kuali - in my understanding they were a response against certain kinds of vendor/commercial provider behaviors for universities to consolidate economic power to build something that fit their own needs in a way commercial vendors were not meeting, reduce cost against high commercial prices for those services. People are here for PB because humanists/artists are often bypassed by commercial sector because isn't profitable. Related but slightly different question - what's different for Microsoft to be a partner in filling these kinds of tools for humanists that wasn't there before? Will we see ourselves creating a consortia for similar reasons as Kuali/Sakai when commercial tools are being made but not the way we like and not at reasonable costs&lt;br /&gt;
Or are partnerships reasonable for exploring?&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/awade/&quot;&gt;Alex Wade&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Landscape is different because my boss came over from e-science in UK and started turning heads in Microsoft and saying they need to change the landscape. Microsoft - less about the pricing of it; they give away nearly the platforms to academia. The bigger issue is not listening to the need of scholars and researchers.  Part of my frustrating in working / academia - pace at which change happens, ability to say &quot;yes, that's a good idea, yes you can act on that&quot; at Microsoft they say &quot; go run with it, we'll fund it&quot; - now frustrated w/ pace of the Office team, and even then they've only taken the top N% of features of interest to their top customers who are paying the bills. Like to optimistically say the environment is changing so we're trying to paint the picture that open source that we'll give to academic community + MS proprietary software = what we'd like to see. Best of both worlds - getting scalability/support of platform, flexibility to take it the last mile.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;If it is a matter of making technical decision about large pieces of infrastructure relating to data storage or network traffic, industry will make those decision or narrow down the choices. Ditto for applications: there are, for instance, two or three relational databases that account for 95% or more of work that uses this technology. It's unclear, then, what needs regulating or coordinating with regard to those choices. Most of the stuff out there is written in six or fewer programming languages, and there may not be much virtue in reducing that limited diversity. Michael Pollan writes very eloquently about the monoculture of corn.&quot; (Tools &amp; Content Partners working group, Analyzing Scholarly Narratives, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.english.northwestern.edu/people/mueller.html&quot;&gt;Martin Mueller&lt;/a&gt;, 3/27/09)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I turn from this confession to a look from the perspective of the Tools and Content workgroup at the scholarly narratives that concern themselves with the study of primary texts.  Language here is the great divider. The work of very few PhD students in English, French, German, Spanish, or Russian will be affected by work on digitizing Tibetan Buddhist manuscripts or inscriptions from the Greek or Semitic parts of the Ancient Mediterranean.  Can one talk about tools and content across different languages? This is a moment to nod gratefully in the direction of Microsoft and Apple. A decade ago multilinguality was still a big headache. Today your standard computer will move effortlessly across many languages both ancient and modern.  The remaining bottleneck is the continuing ability of the modal American programmer to be surprised that there are people in the world whose native language is not English.&quot; (Tools &amp; Content Partners working group, Analyzing Scholarly Narratives, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.english.northwestern.edu/people/mueller.html&quot;&gt;Martin Mueller&lt;/a&gt;, 3/27/09)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
