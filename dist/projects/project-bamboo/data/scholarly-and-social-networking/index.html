<p>"A way to help digital humanists find each other - how many people say to themselves "I'm a digital humanist". Is the fact that they use digital technology key to what they're doing, or are they humanists, and they're in a particular thing, and the digital is a modus operandi. Maybe it wouldn't be so much about introspection about identity, but "I'm a humanist, this has value to me, I'll jump into it." "Digital humanities" is going to be the future, it'll be assumed after a while. I often identify myself that way because it's still relatively new; that'll fall by the wayside in a few years" (<span a="" activities="" and="" bamboo="" be="" best="" by="" class="glossary-term" consortial="" discuss="" effort="" explain="" future="" like="" practices="" supported="" think="" title="Opportunities for Bamboo: " which="" why.="" would="" you=""><abbr a="" activities="" and="" bamboo="" be="" best="" by="" consortial="" discuss="" effort="" explain="" future="" like="" practices="" supported="" think="" title="Opportunities for Bamboo: " which="" why.="" would="" you="">Ex 7</abbr></span>, <span class="glossary-term" title="Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier."><abbr title="Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.">1d</abbr></span>-D)</p>

<p>"Question posed about that we know a bit more about research practices, not so much about communication/collaboration, drivers and practices among humanists. Do we have enough information to go in the right direction? How do we get it? Communication practices - discussion happened in W1 and research has been done about research needs, but when talking about scholarly network this is how they collaborate."

<p>"WHAT: As Senior Academic Technology Officer for the CUNY Graduate Center, I participate actively in a CUNY-wide (20 senior and community colleges, spread across the five boroughs of New York City) Academic Technology (A.T.) committee, which is comprised of CUNY faculty from each of our campuses who are actively engaged in using A.T. for teaching and research. We are in the process of setting up an Academic Commons (AC) website which will allow faculty to engage one another using a range of Web 2.0 resources (e.g., blogs and wikis, CMS, etc.) and to push forward a collective conversation about how best to deploy A.T. across CUNY's myriad teaching and research environments.<br />
HOW: We are focused on being able to offer three interrelated "basic functional pieces": information (the AC should make it easy to publish useful information); identity (the AC should be able to easily display customizable profiles and should allow users to build communities through them via social networking tools); and interaction (tagging, collective editing, commenting).<br />
HELPS: We currently use a Moodle site to stay in touch individually and through our sub-committees, but I'm not certain that this is the best environment for the long term.<br />
NEEDS: Our challenge is to identify the best platform(s) to use to accomplish this set of tasks. What are the best/most optimal hardware and software configurations to use, given learning curves and costs, both human and financial? Open source vs. proprietary; Moodle vs. Drupal vs. WordPress Multi-User vs. Plone; PHP vs. Python; Oracle vs. Flash vs. Microsoft? What are the hidden human resource costs (tech support and faculty development) in setting up and maintaining an open-ended system like this that needs to be scalable?"

<p>"NEED: The Walt Whitman Walking Tour and Online Critical Edition needs support with setup and implementation of a feedback device for users to be able to comment on their experiences during and after they have taken the walking tour. Although my knowledge of web design is strong, it has not proved sufficient to do the backend database setup that is required to design and implement such a system. In order to set up an appropriate user blog, I need some kind of ongoing and direct support in order to get the Web 2.0 elements of the site to a preliminary operational state.
