<p>"Would be missing something important if we went forward thinking about DHum in any context w/o taking account of amount of work/activity that goes in form of "exchange of ideas". Centers typically the hubs of exchanging ideas across disciplines/in relation to various media. How can DHum help support and enhance kinds of idea exchange contexts and situations that tend to take place at centers?"

We're not the only ones who're pursued a piece of a project only to find after months that someone down the hall has already done it.

<p>"Title "Bamboo and Content Stewards" changed to "Clumps and Runners". "Torturing the Bamboo metaphor". Exchange of ideas - lots of work in the humanities carried on this way. There are no ideas but in things. Things in the humanities - wide variety of material and cultural heritage. Tracing DNA in parchment to trace movement across medieval systems of commerce. Lots of interest in things in the humanities." (<span class="glossary-term" title="Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.
