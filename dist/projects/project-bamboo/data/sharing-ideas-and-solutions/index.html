<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Several issues - 1) Lots of groups like ours that independently develop various tools; if that process is something you could buy into where other projects are creating those systems, where you could use it with minimal effort. There's a way where we already do it, but it's more ad hoc. There's enough available already in one way or another; it'd have to show something quite specific and beneficial&quot; (&lt;span a=&quot;&quot; activities=&quot;&quot; and=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; best=&quot;&quot; by=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; consortial=&quot;&quot; discuss=&quot;&quot; effort=&quot;&quot; explain=&quot;&quot; future=&quot;&quot; like=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; supported=&quot;&quot; think=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Opportunities for Bamboo: &quot; which=&quot;&quot; why.=&quot;&quot; would=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr a=&quot;&quot; activities=&quot;&quot; and=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; best=&quot;&quot; by=&quot;&quot; consortial=&quot;&quot; discuss=&quot;&quot; effort=&quot;&quot; explain=&quot;&quot; future=&quot;&quot; like=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; supported=&quot;&quot; think=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Opportunities for Bamboo: &quot; which=&quot;&quot; why.=&quot;&quot; would=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 7&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1c&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-C)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Would be missing something important if we went forward thinking about DHum in any context w/o taking account of amount of work/activity that goes in form of &quot;exchange of ideas&quot;.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ways in which these efforts can help us/other make public what they're doing in dig technologies in relation to humanities. We're not the only ones who're pursued a piece of a project only to find after months that someone down the hall has already done it.

Exchange of ideas - lots of work in the humanities carried on this way. There are no ideas but in things. Things in the humanities - wide variety of material and cultural heritage.
