&lt;p&gt;&quot;Remove the transaction costs at each step of the scholarly process. People want &quot;clean&quot; access across the steps.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I have a good example of this. Had a conference w. collaboration.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The new thing is the openness, but there are still many who aren't willing to share. We took emails of grads &amp; undergrads. Some grads had FaceBook; others didn't want to share info. in that way and they consciously didn't do it. It has to do w.l personality.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Magic wand: &quot; if=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; had=&quot;&quot; a=&quot;&quot; magic=&quot;&quot; wand=&quot;&quot; what=&quot;&quot; would=&quot;&quot; make=&quot;&quot; your=&quot;&quot; day=&quot;&quot; term=&quot;&quot; research=&quot;&quot; cycle=&quot;&quot; more=&quot;&quot; productive=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; relation=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Magic wand: &quot; if=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; had=&quot;&quot; a=&quot;&quot; magic=&quot;&quot; wand=&quot;&quot; what=&quot;&quot; would=&quot;&quot; make=&quot;&quot; your=&quot;&quot; day=&quot;&quot; term=&quot;&quot; research=&quot;&quot; cycle=&quot;&quot; more=&quot;&quot; productive=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; relation=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 6b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1a (Berkeley; April 28-30, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1a (Berkeley; April 28-30, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1a&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-G)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;People are very choosy about who they share with. There's an intergenerational model on publishing. There's a back-an-forth interdependency: You might now depend on a GIS grad student in order to do a degree in a different dept.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Magic wand: &quot; if=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; had=&quot;&quot; a=&quot;&quot; magic=&quot;&quot; wand=&quot;&quot; what=&quot;&quot; would=&quot;&quot; make=&quot;&quot; your=&quot;&quot; day=&quot;&quot; term=&quot;&quot; research=&quot;&quot; cycle=&quot;&quot; more=&quot;&quot; productive=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; relation=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Magic wand: &quot; if=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; had=&quot;&quot; a=&quot;&quot; magic=&quot;&quot; wand=&quot;&quot; what=&quot;&quot; would=&quot;&quot; make=&quot;&quot; your=&quot;&quot; day=&quot;&quot; term=&quot;&quot; research=&quot;&quot; cycle=&quot;&quot; more=&quot;&quot; productive=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; relation=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 6b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1a (Berkeley; April 28-30, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1a (Berkeley; April 28-30, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1a&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-G)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;IP regime that respects the educational use while still allowing creators to benefit from their work -Also, clarity around orphan works if nothing else. How'd you define benefit? It'd vary by the field. Monetary if appropriate; depends on the economics. They might just be happy with someone reading their work. I'd go for something in between; a defined and bounded fair use zone that's cross-institutional, cross-repository, allows certain applications of tools/practices within a bounded space. That space could be both teaching and research. Cross-institutional is really important for licensed resources -Research is more about collaboration across international and cross-intitutional boundaries&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Magic wand: &quot; if=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; had=&quot;&quot; a=&quot;&quot; magic=&quot;&quot; wand=&quot;&quot; what=&quot;&quot; would=&quot;&quot; make=&quot;&quot; your=&quot;&quot; day=&quot;&quot; term=&quot;&quot; research=&quot;&quot; cycle=&quot;&quot; more=&quot;&quot; productive=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; relation=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Magic wand: &quot; if=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; had=&quot;&quot; a=&quot;&quot; magic=&quot;&quot; wand=&quot;&quot; what=&quot;&quot; would=&quot;&quot; make=&quot;&quot; your=&quot;&quot; day=&quot;&quot; term=&quot;&quot; research=&quot;&quot; cycle=&quot;&quot; more=&quot;&quot; productive=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; relation=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 6b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1d&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-C)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We don't have students of our own, our research activities are people who float between institutions; they want to bring our stuff together with stuff from elsewhere.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;[Re: scholarly network.] Access.  Most you can hope for Bamboo to get out of the way to let communities set their own access standards. Evolve a mechanism for knocking on the door in a new conversation.  Not that hard to do technologically.  Needs to be made seamless &amp; effectively effortless.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Questions of identity - better managing identities can allow for a variety of research accesses to materials that might otherwise look like threats to those kinds of installations (multiple hits from counting tools on data sets)&lt;br /&gt;
Might be related to, how might we negotiate with owners of collections of archives that are protective of their sources?

&lt;p&gt;&quot;How do we handle identities to allow for research types of access to repositories etc. (types of access that otherwise might look like malicious attacks)? How might bamboo facilitate archives that are protective of their sources to feel secure enough to open them up to uses through bamboo?&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Licensing and IPR discussion, then told it was beyond scope. Everything else we talked about was provisional on Licensing being made possible. Maybe Bamboo could establish different levels of access that might be given to certain people for certain kinds of content. Might design/promote tools to provide different levels of access.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The second problem is the inability or difficulty for researchers to access audiovisual records related to Performing Arts. These are, in most cases, viewable only at the institution that houses them. Even when one is able to view the material, copying for later re-examination is often impossible due to copyright issues. Additionally, quoting is always done indirectly in written form, and is inevitably vague as it is impractical to reference timecode on a tape that one doesn't possess. We can certainly affirm that, compared to other fields in the Humanities, and even more so if compared to research in science, the quality of research in Performing Arts is hampered by the general difficulty in accessing records.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Scholarly Narratives emerged from W2, describing or exemplifying practices, work, tools and collaboration the community believed should impact and should be impacted by the work of Project Bamboo.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Not only tech problems, but process problems that stop flow of information. Copyright: legal barriers, and our own processes put on top of legal barriers. Don't have good processes for differentiating between research requests for data, and publication requests for data. Have to think about this and work through it. Need to streamline process for pub rights. Libraries beginning to offer services to help researchers w/ copyright issues. Help lower barriers by working w/ owners of licensed content. Not everyone's as generous as JSTOR in sharing data w/ researchers. Developing new language for license agreements to streamline process. Lib has a good community method for doing this work w/ licensed data. PB can help w/ this by creating community of support w/in libraries.
