&lt;p&gt;&quot;How will Bamboo take its material to the stakeholders?&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; accomplish=&quot;&quot; questions=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; regarding=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; accomplish=&quot;&quot; questions=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; regarding=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 1&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-E)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There's a non-technological deliverable. How do we get the message out? There's no incentive for people to look for it (until they know what the value is).&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; accomplish=&quot;&quot; questions=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; regarding=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; accomplish=&quot;&quot; questions=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; regarding=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 1&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-F)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Work goes in cycles - users get used to doing certain things; Or brainwashed. Use of Blackboard as an example, the use of this in the classroom becomes expected. First cycle captures small sub-group that &quot;get it&quot;.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; accomplish=&quot;&quot; questions=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; regarding=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; accomplish=&quot;&quot; questions=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; regarding=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 1&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1c&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-A)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Make it a natural part of the scholar's workflow - collective as well as individual level, across disciplines, across boundaries, institutional conservative&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; accomplish=&quot;&quot; questions=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; regarding=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; accomplish=&quot;&quot; questions=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; regarding=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 1&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1d&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-D)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;what's the ROI? will it take so long to learn the tool that it doesn't pay off. is there a relationship between the tool and the broader process?&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Magic wand: &quot; if=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; had=&quot;&quot; a=&quot;&quot; magic=&quot;&quot; wand=&quot;&quot; what=&quot;&quot; would=&quot;&quot; make=&quot;&quot; your=&quot;&quot; day=&quot;&quot; term=&quot;&quot; research=&quot;&quot; cycle=&quot;&quot; more=&quot;&quot; productive=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; relation=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Magic wand: &quot; if=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; had=&quot;&quot; a=&quot;&quot; magic=&quot;&quot; wand=&quot;&quot; what=&quot;&quot; would=&quot;&quot; make=&quot;&quot; your=&quot;&quot; day=&quot;&quot; term=&quot;&quot; research=&quot;&quot; cycle=&quot;&quot; more=&quot;&quot; productive=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; relation=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 6b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-A)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It like to &quot;inject some valium&quot; into humanities scholars to calm the fear of technologies.  Smartness isn't the barrier ... fear of the technology is.  Might be fear of how they might be changed, fear of dependence, fear of not knowing something.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Magic wand: &quot; if=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; had=&quot;&quot; a=&quot;&quot; magic=&quot;&quot; wand=&quot;&quot; what=&quot;&quot; would=&quot;&quot; make=&quot;&quot; your=&quot;&quot; day=&quot;&quot; term=&quot;&quot; research=&quot;&quot; cycle=&quot;&quot; more=&quot;&quot; productive=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; relation=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Magic wand: &quot; if=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; had=&quot;&quot; a=&quot;&quot; magic=&quot;&quot; wand=&quot;&quot; what=&quot;&quot; would=&quot;&quot; make=&quot;&quot; your=&quot;&quot; day=&quot;&quot; term=&quot;&quot; research=&quot;&quot; cycle=&quot;&quot; more=&quot;&quot; productive=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; relation=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 6b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-B)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Lots of reasons not to use new technologies ... a well-informed&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Magic wand: &quot; if=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; had=&quot;&quot; a=&quot;&quot; magic=&quot;&quot; wand=&quot;&quot; what=&quot;&quot; would=&quot;&quot; make=&quot;&quot; your=&quot;&quot; day=&quot;&quot; term=&quot;&quot; research=&quot;&quot; cycle=&quot;&quot; more=&quot;&quot; productive=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; relation=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Magic wand: &quot; if=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; had=&quot;&quot; a=&quot;&quot; magic=&quot;&quot; wand=&quot;&quot; what=&quot;&quot; would=&quot;&quot; make=&quot;&quot; your=&quot;&quot; day=&quot;&quot; term=&quot;&quot; research=&quot;&quot; cycle=&quot;&quot; more=&quot;&quot; productive=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; relation=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 6b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-B)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Reason for falling behind in IT because research assistants are sometimes more advanced making us lazy.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Would like to have people who are clever in interfaces work on these projects.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Problem is that technology is continually meant to give us more time, though it never does because it takes time to learn new technologies. If technology can be designed so that it &quot;actually&quot; saves time.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;More promotion in administration means more difficulty in learning technologies. Suite of things that would mean the level of skills we need to have could be lowered.
