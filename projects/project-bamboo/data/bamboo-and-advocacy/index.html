<p>"What is PB advocating for? And to whom? - resources, legitimacy, institutional. What standing would PB reps have in internal discussions? How would PB acquire the necessary standing?

<p>"Risk of mixing directions for Bamboo (things it should try to do) and things that Bamboo has to do to be a project (there has to be outreach). If you want to influence pedagogy of humanities scholarship, that's a mission you decide you want to take. They're not both directions - you can say Bamboo should advocate for digital humanities, or it can do marketing of what it does."

<p>"If we develop tools for scholars, we have to understand their intellectual climate in the professional world. We have a moral responsibility to at some level become advocates - that doesn't mean we have to define standards of scholarship, just supply a form or work with groups more involved in doing this kind of work.

<p>"Recognition that at different stages of its maturation, PB will be better/less well equipped to advocate. To be pragmatic, first to advocate for its own relevance. Later, once that's established and there's models in place showing how it can function, maybe then it becomes an advocating body (by example, explicitly). Talking about advocating as a generic whole from the beginning is too abstract."

<p>"Need a hand in the conversation about if there's ways that tools can be constructed to allow for humanities contributions to databases to serve for those purposes. Not going to advocate for faculty contributing to repositories, but that could influence how repositories are structured (including things like timestamps, etc.) Not going to the deans and advocating to them, but keep those issues in mind as we develop other tools."
