        <p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;How can PB determine the boundaries of its remit re: advocacy in &quot;high-commonality problems&quot; (such as identity management, IP, promotion and tenure)?&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki. Participants suggested questions and issues for each Direction, and formed groups to delve further into their chosen Direction, including what aspects are within the scope of Project Bamboo, what Demonstrators would be helpful, and what the plan should be for the working group.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki. Participants suggested questions and issues for each Direction, and formed groups to delve further into their chosen Direction, including what aspects are within the scope of Project Bamboo, what Demonstrators would be helpful, and what the plan should be for the working group.&quot;&gt;W2&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Advocacy, questions and concerns, plenary notes, group 3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;What is PB advocating for? And to whom? - resources, legitimacy, institutional. What standing would PB reps have in internal discussions? How would PB acquire the necessary standing? Certification and legitimacy of dig scholarly practice - PB's role? Is it even possible? How can PB come into an institution and tell them what to do?&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki. Participants suggested questions and issues for each Direction, and formed groups to delve further into their chosen Direction, including what aspects are within the scope of Project Bamboo, what Demonstrators would be helpful, and what the plan should be for the working group.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Risk of mixing directions for Bamboo (things it should try to do) and things that Bamboo has to do to be a project (there has to be outreach). If you want to influence pedagogy of humanities scholarship, that's a mission you decide you want to take. They're not both directions - you can say Bamboo should advocate for digital humanities, or it can do marketing of what it does.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki. Participants suggested questions and issues for each Direction, and formed groups to delve further into their chosen Direction, including what aspects are within the scope of Project Bamboo, what Demonstrators would be helpful, and what the plan should be for the working group.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;If we develop tools for scholars, we have to understand their intellectual climate in the professional world. We have a moral responsibility to at some level become advocates - that doesn't mean we have to define standards of scholarship, just supply a form or work with groups more involved in doing this kind of work. Could even be a secondary role&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki. Participants suggested questions and issues for each Direction, and formed groups to delve further into their chosen Direction, including what aspects are within the scope of Project Bamboo, what Demonstrators would be helpful, and what the plan should be for the working group.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Recognition that at different stages of its maturation, PB will be better/less well equipped to advocate. To be pragmatic, first to advocate for its own relevance. Later, once that's established and there's models in place showing how it can function, maybe then it becomes an advocating body (by example, explicitly). Talking about advocating as a generic whole from the beginning is too abstract.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki. Participants suggested questions and issues for each Direction, and formed groups to delve further into their chosen Direction, including what aspects are within the scope of Project Bamboo, what Demonstrators would be helpful, and what the plan should be for the working group.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Need a hand in the conversation about if there's ways that tools can be constructed to allow for humanities contributions to databases to serve for those purposes. Not going to advocate for faculty contributing to repositories, but that could influence how repositories are structured (including things like timestamps, etc.) Not going to the deans and advocating to them, but keep those issues in mind as we develop other tools.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki. Participants suggested questions and issues for each Direction, and formed groups to delve further into their chosen Direction, including what aspects are within the scope of Project Bamboo, what Demonstrators would be helpful, and what the plan should be for the working group.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Better ways of doing this and that; waste a lot of psychological energy and time going into meta-issues of faculty prestige. Things are changing - more positions available for new media specialists. Things will take care of themselves; we've got enough to do building better tools and resources to help people do things better and faster&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki. Participants suggested questions and issues for each Direction, and formed groups to delve further into their chosen Direction, including what aspects are within the scope of Project Bamboo, what Demonstrators would be helpful, and what the plan should be for the working group.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Issue of disinterestedness; may make it easier to articulate the sheer use value of the tools part if Bamboo isn't also getting into more political issues. Won't have to identify itself with positions on those issues.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki. Participants suggested questions and issues for each Direction, and formed groups to delve further into their chosen Direction, including what aspects are within the scope of Project Bamboo, what Demonstrators would be helpful, and what the plan should be for the working group.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;PB should be a catalyst for change, thought this leadership role had cross-cutting dimension; this could be taken on by oversight body but for now we didn't want to put ourselves out of business, so Advocacy group needed &quot;advocates&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
There's a role for it, had specific ideas for it&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki. Participants suggested questions and issues for each Direction, and formed groups to delve further into their chosen Direction, including what aspects are within the scope of Project Bamboo, what Demonstrators would be helpful, and what the plan should be for the working group.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Abstract application/ what is the mechanism for the principles (which are larger than this working group) to be collected, facilitated, and articulated. Principles coming out of working groups could be evaluated and some suggestions sent back (for example, an urge to come up with principles such as a commitment to openness).&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki. Participants suggested questions and issues for each Direction, and formed groups to delve further into their chosen Direction, including what aspects are within the scope of Project Bamboo, what Demonstrators would be helpful, and what the plan should be for the working group.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Risks: Changing our title from advocacy to leadership is a reaction to the risk that Bamboo cannot be an advocacy organization - we believe that it's risky for Bamboo to position itself that way, at least at first, before we've demonstrated our utility.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki. Participants suggested questions and issues for each Direction, and formed groups to delve further into their chosen Direction, including what aspects are within the scope of Project Bamboo, what Demonstrators would be helpful, and what the plan should be for the working group.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We want to underline that this role or direction can be phased -- we can start with advocating for Bamboo itself, using our leadership position to articulate the principles being developed by the directions.  A more explicit advocacy role may develop with time, around issues like fair use, orphan works, and other intellectual property issues.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki. Participants suggested questions and issues for each Direction, and formed groups to delve further into their chosen Direction, including what aspects are within the scope of Project Bamboo, what Demonstrators would be helpful, and what the plan should be for the working group.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Can we develop a rich, attractive dig hum culture by mainstreaming e-scholarship methods, practices and educational opportunities into traditional disciplines? Easier for scholars whose work is primarily methodological to engage with digital humanities, vs. those doing interpretive work&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki.
