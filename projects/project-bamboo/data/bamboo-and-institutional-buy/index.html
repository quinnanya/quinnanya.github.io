<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Looking at the elevated pitch, how to get faculty and administrators to support this? What are faculty and university needs, how do we support that? Concerns: need more clarity, concrete rational for long-term support. Don't end arguments for continuing, as long as we keep seeing traction.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Proposition values of Bamboo: why Bamboo, how will it tie into other things, can begin to help build skeletal structure and answer questions as we go. Need a &quot;commitment roadmap&quot; - administrators want to see how much it'll cost, what it'll look like.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;One other suggestion from faculty member: possibly having the PIs from the team and others contact each provosts/chancellors and thank them for their continued support. We've done some ground-up stuff, but how about the other way?&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Institutions: &quot;What will PB do for us?&quot; We can't give you that answer - we need to now who'll be in the effort, and what kind of resources you'll have&lt;br /&gt;
Important here: as we think about what PB is going to do is continue to compile examples of how to leverage Bamboo. Where some of the best investments are.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Introductory Remarks, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;David Greenbaum, Director of Data Services at the University of California, Berkeley, was a Co-Director of the Bamboo Planning Project.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;David Greenbaum, Director of Data Services at the University of California, Berkeley, was a Co-Director of the Bamboo Planning Project.&quot;&gt;David Greenbaum&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Schedule conversations w/ institutions and organizations to gauge interest/commitment. What being part of PB means; a lot have been asking for printed materials - value statements, elevator pitch. Also need room for conversations re: what it means for institution to be in PB. We won't know what we can do with PB (what we have at this workshop today) until we know who's interested in being part of PB in our implementation proposal.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Introductory Remarks, flow between workshop, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Chad J.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;With extended teams, it's important to have conversations w/ us to get a better sense of where we're going, what it means for your institution/community. Continue editing and refining process until when we submit this, and well after. Need to keep tuning this, making sure the program and long-term mission are right. Over time, we'll continue to refer to it and look back on. &quot;Back in 2008, we had this idea...&quot; Hopefully in 2011 we'll look back at that. Things have changed, but maybe we can evolve that concept.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Introductory Remarks, flow between workshop, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Chad J.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Institutions need to see value of PB, for teaching and research. Use of IT services for archiving material (possibly even unpublished research outcomes); this is important. Supporting work of upcoming scholars in particular is important &quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The Bamboo Program Document (drafts published March-April 2009) was a an outline for a possible 7-10 year vision for the Bamboo Community, discussed at Workshop 4.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;The Bamboo Program Document (drafts published March-April 2009) was a an outline for a possible 7-10 year vision for the Bamboo Community, discussed at Workshop 4.&quot;&gt;Program Document&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Section 3, Discussion of Poll #1, Faculty table discussion)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Benefits of technology: keeps us focused on core mission of university, which is exciting. Risk: appears to administration like it's tech for tech's sake. We have to show a clear value to participants/administrators. Need to have a 1-year implementation forces us to do that.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The Bamboo Program Document (drafts published March-April 2009) was a an outline for a possible 7-10 year vision for the Bamboo Community, discussed at Workshop 4.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;The Bamboo Program Document (drafts published March-April 2009) was a an outline for a possible 7-10 year vision for the Bamboo Community, discussed at Workshop 4.&quot;&gt;Program Document&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Section 3, Discussion of Poll #1, IT table discussion)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Convinced table to agree there's a problem here. Looking at 7-10 year program, why we're doing Bamboo. Have to go back and justify to administration why they should be invested in PB. Maybe we don't need to hassle them with document, we need something that catches the excellence of why it's worth coming together. Risk in document is the document itself - creating high expectations of what PB can develop. Benefits - faculty might be grateful to us. We should get on with what you can do with a million dollars a year. Not publish a document re: what we'd do with 20 million dollars, because we're not going to get it.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The Bamboo Program Document (drafts published March-April 2009) was a an outline for a possible 7-10 year vision for the Bamboo Community, discussed at Workshop 4.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;The Bamboo Program Document (drafts published March-April 2009) was a an outline for a possible 7-10 year vision for the Bamboo Community, discussed at Workshop 4.&quot;&gt;Program Document&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Section 3, Discussion of Poll #1, IT table discussion)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;This comes up in service atlas, but also in recipes: idea that there needs to be a tight focus on what needs to be built in years 1/2. Proof of overall vision/design for going forward. Nothing explicit in plan in terms of activity. Highlights need for &quot;This is good technology&quot; - tool, interoperability standard, dependencies, etc. How is that going to evolve, does there need to be more work about why a tool is good, why standards should be adopted, why Bamboo?&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Action Plan - 4.1 Services &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The Atlas was a somewhat amorphous piece of the Bamboo Implementation Plan.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;&quot;What am I gonna tell my administration? Why support this? Why do we do anything? How do we evaluate/justify what this is going to be?&quot; How can we measure? Quantitative? Qualitative? I don't see that. We're assuming we know what we're doing, why this matters I don't have a concrete narrative, but it's beyond that. I don't have anything I can tell the administration about how they'll get more bang for their buck, why not just put the money in financial aid? We need to crystallize this. It's sorta in scholarly narratives, but that's just raw material for this - it's not this.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Discussion of Section 3 and Section 4 Poll #2)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Will need a lot of trust in partnerships between institutions.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oit.umn.edu/consultation-services/team-members/brad-cohen/index.htm&quot;&gt;Bradley Cohen&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;In document, but not presentation, members pay to play. Pay for privilege. What's the sell for my institution to pay to play when several of us are happy to play and contribute whatever we can find. Chance to lead and shape?

That's a lot of investment - how do we capture that? Dollar amount question is one we need to wrestle with. How do we do that without pushing people out the door, but also doesn't turn into an incentive for creating an administrative monster that consumes all the available resources that don't end up generating much stuff. Like any project, PB needs to give value back in some way. Could show up more in research administration area. There's value in being associated with it - formal contribution to formal relationship.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The Bamboo Program Document (drafts published March-April 2009) was a an outline for a possible 7-10 year vision for the Bamboo Community, discussed at Workshop 4.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;The Bamboo Program Document (drafts published March-April 2009) was a an outline for a possible 7-10 year vision for the Bamboo Community, discussed at Workshop 4.&quot;&gt;Program Document&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Section 5)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
