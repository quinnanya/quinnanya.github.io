<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Gaps: 1. what do humanities scholars and students presently want to be able to do in research and pedagogical terms that they seem unable to do given present IT? i.e. what might we want to see created or generated? what might PB highlight (and advocate for) as unfulfilled digital humanities needs? 2. what IT capacities and possibilities (from the established to the experimental) already exist that are underutilized in the advancement of scholarship and teaching by humanities scholars and students? i.e., what might PB highlight (and affirm) as digital tools, programs, or processes of promise to the humanities?&quot; (Education working group, 11/20/08 memo)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;The [Thought Ark] tool can be incorporated in academic teaching and research of any kind, from sciences to humanities. However, it is most appropriate for humanities, since it emphasizes resource discovery, sharing, evaluating and usage. It has the ability to create a federation of sites (the software is designed to allow multiple, interoprable and mutually discoverable platforms) and to scale up with usage to any necessary level of complexity, depth and detail. It can be used both for focus and for exploratory research. It can also be used for interaction between students and between students and their professors.&quot; (Tools &amp; Content Partners working group, Thought Ark Demonstrator, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.matei.org/&quot;&gt;Sorin Matei&lt;/a&gt;, 12/8/08)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Secondary and tertiary education students and their instructors can use the Thought Ark platform to search and retrieve collaboratively resources from local or remote databases or publications. The search results are saved in a abbreviated and standardized format in a user folder. Tagging, commenting on, or organizing resources into lists is also provided for. Each citation gets a popularity score, based on the combined number of times it was searched, viewed or otherwise utilized (such as in cited in a paper), times it was tagged, and subjective rating. Scores are weighted by types of users, instructors and higher GPA students usage patterns having a greater impact. Scores are employed by the system to decide how relevant a resource is. The platform includes an active social networking component. Users can search for information by querying the citation folders of their peers'. For example, a student enrolled in a technology class writing a paper on Wikipedia can either search for the term Wikipedia globally, or it can search for citations in folders created by other users interested in Wikipedia, regardless if the papers contain or not the target term. Furthermore, users can limit her search by focusing only on instructors, TAs, or only on students with a specific major. The manner in which each citation was visited and ultimately determines not only how valuable resources are but also for generating conceptual networks. For each citation there is a a list of &quot;related&quot; citations, derived from users search and usage patterns, which indicates that &quot;users who read this this book also used this other book&quot;. In other words, citations will be clustered according to the concurrent usage patterns. The Thought Ark platform will not be a simple search engine. It will be an active research aid and social networking tool.&quot; (Tools &amp; Content Partners working group, Thought Ark Demonstrator, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.matei.org/&quot;&gt;Sorin Matei&lt;/a&gt;, 12/8/08)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;As a preliminary step to accomplishing some of these lofty goals [for education working group], we have discussed the need for advocacy. Advocacy not necessarily as a way to bring the luddites on board but as a way to help us make convincing arguments to university administrators about the need to not just provide us with the basics (such as software licenses, IT support, and smart classrooms) but also to support us in rethinking curriculum, rethinking the very design and function of our current classrooms, and rethinking some of the foundational aspects of our current model of teaching and learning.&quot; (Education working group, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.loriemerson.com/&quot;&gt;Lori Emerson&lt;/a&gt;, 1/12/2009 post)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;At UW, we're realizing that while students have largely made the jump to Web 2.0, our IT systems and pedagogies are 1.0 at best. Simply &quot;allowing&quot; students to generate wikis and mash-ups is raising all sorts of technical, legal, and conceptual issues.&quot; (Education working group, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.english.wisc.edu/mckenzie/&quot;&gt;Jon McKenzie&lt;/a&gt;, 1/12/2009 post)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Institutions interested in PB who will probably drop out if there'es not enough emphasis on education, especially small liberal arts.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dynamic interface with information of the site and possibly a blog archive. Inform practices in research and teaching. Facilitate access to established work in digital humanities. Capture imagination of non-initiated faculty and students. Provide access to and communicate news about/in digital humanities. Feature meta-critical approaches to digital humanities. Scale available information / tools to established and neophyte faculty and students in humanities, from syllabus development to extensive research [models?]. Visualization / Relationship tools. Bring information from outside of Bamboo into Bamboo. Address the divide between research and pedagogy in the humanities. Facilitate strategies for modeling, finding, and accessing new digital humanities labs and classrooms.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Action Plan - 3.5 Education Materials)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Selectively treat and sample projects to make this process concrete. Target existing activities and begin to assemble them.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Scholarly narratives - selected in first year; should be able to be looked at through educational lens. How/what kind of tool, way of looking at things; ways to focus/highlight how education works, what role education plays.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;We're delighted here with the emphasis on teaching and pedagogy and I would like to supplement Mary's good point about focusing on undergraduate teaching with a call for us to make sure that we include doctoral students as active partners/members in PB. Doctoral students are an important bridge (and Jeff himself is a good example of this) between faculty doing digital humanities and the growing use of digital technology to enhance teaching and learning in the undergraduate classrooms.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Action Plan - 3.5 Education Materials, 4/20/2009 wiki comment, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newmedialab.cuny.edu/people/brier/&quot;&gt;Steve Brier&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Considered whether Bamboo had a unique role (were others addressing area) when making priorities; most of the sections are potential to be high - for a lot of people, it's either high or low priority, with little medium; my colleague and I think education is very important to push out DH into scholarship.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Discussion of Section 3 Poll #1, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.library.illinois.edu/faculty/TimCole3.htm&quot;&gt;Tim Cole&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Educational and Curricular materials important for us too, to drive transformation of scholarly practice.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Discussion of Section 3 Poll #1, Greg from U.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Re Education [12 votes for high interest, 7 for medium, 6 for low, 3 for none]- suggests a possible divide between research and curricular orientations, the research vs. liberal arts colleges?&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Discussion of Section 3 Poll #1, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dfd.dartmouth.edu/profiles/93&quot;&gt;Mark Williams&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Didn't want to vote all high priorities, so something had to be low. Education got low because it seemed there would be other ways of getting educational materials than by Bamboo's creation and curation of them.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Discussion of Section 3 Poll #1, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slis.indiana.edu/faculty/spotlight/index.php?facid=97&quot;&gt;Stacy Kowalczyk&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Voted low on Educ. There's a tension between the &quot;convince the dean&quot; problem (which would suggest higher rating to Educ) and the value of research ... figuring that from Brown's perspective, doing research is what faculty actually engage in fully.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Discussion of Section 3 Poll #1, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stg.brown.edu/staff/elli.html&quot;&gt;Elli Mylonas&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Rated Educ high for same reasons others rated it low. Education and Instructional material needs to become more visible in the proposal.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Discussion of Section 3 Poll #1, Jeff from CUNY)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
