<p>"Gaps: 1. what do humanities scholars and students presently want to be able to do in research and pedagogical terms that they seem unable to do given present IT? i.e. what might we want to see created or generated? what might PB highlight (and advocate for) as unfulfilled digital humanities needs? 2. what IT capacities and possibilities (from the established to the experimental) already exist that are underutilized in the advancement of scholarship and teaching by humanities scholars and students? i.e., what might PB highlight (and affirm) as digital tools, programs, or processes of promise to the humanities?" (Education working group, 11/20/08 memo)</p>
<p>"The [Thought Ark] tool can be incorporated in academic teaching and research of any kind, from sciences to humanities. However, it is most appropriate for humanities, since it emphasizes resource discovery, sharing, evaluating and usage. It has the ability to create a federation of sites (the software is designed to allow multiple, interoprable and mutually discoverable platforms) and to scale up with usage to any necessary level of complexity, depth and detail. It can be used both for focus and for exploratory research. It can also be used for interaction between students and between students and their professors." (Tools &amp; Content Partners working group, Thought Ark Demonstrator, <a href="http://www.matei.org/">Sorin Matei</a>, 12/8/08)</p>
<p>"Secondary and tertiary education students and their instructors can use the Thought Ark platform to search and retrieve collaboratively resources from local or remote databases or publications. The search results are saved in a abbreviated and standardized format in a user folder. Tagging, commenting on, or organizing resources into lists is also provided for. Each citation gets a popularity score, based on the combined number of times it was searched, viewed or otherwise utilized (such as in cited in a paper), times it was tagged, and subjective rating. Scores are weighted by types of users, instructors and higher GPA students usage patterns having a greater impact. Scores are employed by the system to decide how relevant a resource is. The platform includes an active social networking component. Users can search for information by querying the citation folders of their peers'. For example, a student enrolled in a technology class writing a paper on Wikipedia can either search for the term Wikipedia globally, or it can search for citations in folders created by other users interested in Wikipedia, regardless if the papers contain or not the target term. Furthermore, users can limit her search by focusing only on instructors, TAs, or only on students with a specific major. The manner in which each citation was visited and ultimately determines not only how valuable resources are but also for generating conceptual networks. For each citation there is a a list of "related" citations, derived from users search and usage patterns, which indicates that "users who read this this book also used this other book". In other words, citations will be clustered according to the concurrent usage patterns. The Thought Ark platform will not be a simple search engine. It will be an active research aid and social networking tool." (Tools &amp; Content Partners working group, Thought Ark Demonstrator, <a href="http://www.matei.org/">Sorin Matei</a>, 12/8/08)</p>
<p>"As a preliminary step to accomplishing some of these lofty goals [for education working group], we have discussed the need for advocacy. Advocacy not necessarily as a way to bring the luddites on board but as a way to help us make convincing arguments to university administrators about the need to not just provide us with the basics (such as software licenses, IT support, and smart classrooms) but also to support us in rethinking curriculum, rethinking the very design and function of our current classrooms, and rethinking some of the foundational aspects of our current model of teaching and learning."
