<p>"Virtual collaboration piece - how does scholarly networking interface w/ community, w/ all the other pieces? If the community is about expressing Bamboo, advocating for particular approaches, best practices, connecting, collaborating, continuing community, sharing ideas/resources/etc, then virtual environment should support our activities/tools/etc. Current set of tools is probably inadequate for moving forward. We just have to do this, not the kind of thing we start in January and hopefully it's done by following January - kind of useless that way. Should look at demonstrator, integrate community into governance, and between now and December, launch demonstrator that does requirements analysis, looks at what we need to be doing to get the right capabilities for collaboration, then extend Bamboo beyond the boundaries of this community. Move forward with an implementation in that demonstrator, to have a 0.9 version around December. So it's ready for January."

<p>Q: "I think that's where the issue of advocacy becomes rather important; community of Bamboo relates to communities that exist in local areas. Those communities in local areas need to link design and engineering with IT with researchers. That's what needs to be done at the local level for successful projects. Bamboo wants to have a structure that facilitates collaboration in local areas, feeds into it; advocacy: those teams we're talking about are almost normal in the context of the sciences, to the extent that if they're developing a major project, can say "in this case, we want a film editing person working with us, etc" can go to school of art, bring them in. They have the resources to have a mixed community necessary to achieve objectives. They'll stretch into the humanities to do that. We want to reverse that project, with putting humanities at the center. Will link into community of people locally, but we at Bamboo can show models for how that can work effectively for the Humanities. And then create kind of resources in long term that will facilitate that."

<p>"We may want to call out specific leadership to make sure right things are moving forward, might want to consider that for community. Will have to wrangle a lot of "stuff" to coordinate things and keep it together. Shift of scholarly networking to UI-focused entity: one problem is coordinating activity across units. Executive committee: leaders of different working groups, executive director, "Bamboo office", and a program manager who is responsible for wrangling all the activity to keep it on target/path/message, all the "on's". Need to make sure that on proposals submitted, Bamboo continues to deliver on what it's promised. Focus on program-related duties; how does services platform and work of services platform folks interact w/ other services activities."

<p>"We had an issue about the logical ordering of proposal, people were reacting to splitting things out, but uniformly recognition of power of working together as community.

<p>"Important to capture this as part of the story of the planning process. Interesting observation looking at this project, in conversations, we applied for an internal institutional grant, got funding to come do this-- these stories we need. Much more community than we ever imagined. If you have a story saying that you could participate for doing something cool, demonstrators opened up new opportunities, enabled conversations, triggered new ways of thinking, etc. - we need these stories. Helps re-enforce community case for PB, not just technology. Really makes a point about how important working together is, what we view as potential; not just stuff, but connections/opportunities that OUR social networking has enabled."
