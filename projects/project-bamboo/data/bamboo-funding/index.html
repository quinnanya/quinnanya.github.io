<p>"Critical gaps that could be addressed: since funding model is very unclear now, and sounds like the farther you are into gray area the less likely that you'll be getting any funding from PB, but maybe using PB services, maybe a mechanism for some sort of cost-shared role for PB to say "we're providing this service, it's worth X, you can fold into your other grants to use as a support for your related work"."

<p>"Q: So why would they go to PB to explore, except there's some resources there that make it more possible? Is that the case? Do you envision having resources there? A: PB isn't meant to become a funding agency - what are the other funding elements? Deeper resources from other institutions? There'll be some outcome from this, for better or worse.

<p>"But in the beginning it wouldn't be a bad idea to have a few PB sanctioned labs doing fundamental exploration. Then we get to resource issues - labor isn't free, but you're not a funding agency.

If it's a successful proposal, and financial world doesn't change again, they're holding about a million dollars per year for the next several years as investment for Bamboo. High-priority project for them. Pushing us on building and doing and constructing something that could be of value for many universities. Institutional conversations: people's general ability to stay involved, and what that looks like. Presume we have 25-30 institutions staying involved even in a minor way, hopefully a number in a significant way -- those are 2 resource pools. Berkeley/Chicago are committed, but we also have financial situation to deal with. Trying to look at total pool, what it'll be, use that as factor to adjust the work. We want to scale down from what we had in program document, scale down further here, figure out most important things. Did rough calculations a month or two ago, but even in last month, for some institutions things have gotten tighter. Could we be in a situation where we could have (this is rough), total resources of $3 mil per year? Maybe it's more? Leadership role - 2 programmers, more, could equal $250k itself-- not a lot of people were able/willing to make that commitment yet. What that will total up to be, how that can be shifted around, we need to figure this out. We need to get best thoughts for what's really important, and use that to prioritize. Things have gotten harder for us re: resources."

<p>"Concern re: governance and other things - any external funding would be eaten by administration. How do we minimize that? Membership fees: financial investment and resource investment. Fees = what does it take for us to sustain this community? Workshop(s). Outreach, coordination, contest idea, that takes resources. Potentially in the future, as services platform comes up, eventually you have to pay for technology underneath these things for them to run. Membership fees look at sustaining/maintaining Bamboo as a community moving forward. Members: student enrollment of 3500 or less: $6000/yr + $9k equal resource investment; over 3500, $8k/$12k ERI. Affiliates: non-profit: $6k/$9k ERI. Commercial, for profit, up to $2.5m; $8k/$12k ERI. Commercial, for profit, over $2.5m; $10k/$15k ERI. Looked at Sakai for the commercial rates. Leadership requires an additional financial/ERI requirement. Don't have anything for financial model for this at this point. Idea is for leadership part to focus in on project management/coordination across all different projects. Trying to keep overhead to a minimum. Executive director, program manager, part-time communicators officer. Looking at Kuali, other projects. Comparing to things like Internet2 with a lot of overhead. Being creative about how we can accomplish work with different institutional investments. Needs to be more put into governance section; how much do we need for proposal vs for community?"

<p>"Lateral to issue of community, but relevant to it - in discussion yesterday, consciously slipped out of discussing the second category of payment that you had in there, for the leadership component; it was there in the diagram, but it wasn't taken up or developed. Seeing it in terms of payment is a problem. Have an idea that what is going to exist in long term is 2 levels: consortium, and membership. Consortium: those institutions who have resources (computational, financial, etc) to be the building blocks if you get a structure going. Don't want to make that criteria for using it, being a member. Asking, do you have local resources/service you want to put towards Bamboo? Heading towards that. Do you need to build that into the structure you're doing; then it begins to answer what the community is. A community necessary to work hard together, keep service agreements, and a community that are just paying as members. These people will really be a community, because they'll be an active network. Then there's the wider issue of it being open to everyone."

So program officers who present this to board understand what's going on, how to appropriately represent. Clarifying points, addressing issues. Having these conversations and feedback on drafts at workshops-- when we present drafts, we can say "look, it's been community design". Important to capture this as part of the story of the planning process."
