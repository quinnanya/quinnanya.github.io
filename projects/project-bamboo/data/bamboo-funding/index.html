&lt;p&gt;&quot;Wanted to float idea of establishing grant opportunities, esp for teaching and pedagogy development -- not even necessarily big grant opportunities&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Relationship between consortium and implementation phase - will consortium be enough? Will you set up a consortium between participating institutions, then use as a springboard for various applications for funding? This could give more independence/flexibility to consortium; implications for ownership of Bamboo ground.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I can't see our [&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The Bamboo Planning Project received funding from the Andrew W.

We hope to contribute catalytic resources, but we've assumed all along that additional build-outs (connecting of Bamboo to other connections) would be funded by a mix of places. Anywhere anyone can find money. No need to worry about our engagement - we'll be evaluating on our best judgment for sustainability, plausibility given resources, and our board will evaluate based on whether foci line up with the Arts and Humanities scholarship they're inclined to support.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'd measure success if individual projects could seek funding knowing there's resources and capabilities and community behind those projects to make them successful/help them be successful. Bamboo helps give those projects initial leverage. There's not One Grand Funding Moment, but creating opportunities for a lot of innovation to occur.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Critical gaps that could be addressed: since funding model is very unclear now, and sounds like the farther you are into gray area the less likely that you'll be getting any funding from PB, but maybe using PB services, maybe a mechanism for some sort of cost-shared role for PB to say &quot;we're providing this service, it's worth X, you can fold into your other grants to use as a support for your related work&quot;.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups. A straw consortial model for Project Bamboo was also introduced and discussed.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Q: So why would they go to PB to explore, except there's some resources there that make it more possible? Is that the case? Do you envision having resources there? A: PB isn't meant to become a funding agency - what are the other funding elements? Deeper resources from other institutions? There'll be some outcome from this, for better or worse. There's an allocation issue built inside of this.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The Bamboo Program Document (drafts published March-April 2009) was a an outline for a possible 7-10 year vision for the Bamboo Community, discussed at Workshop 4.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;The Bamboo Program Document (drafts published March-April 2009) was a an outline for a possible 7-10 year vision for the Bamboo Community, discussed at Workshop 4.&quot;&gt;Program Document&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Section 5, Q&amp;A, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Chad J.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;But in the beginning it wouldn't be a bad idea to have a few PB sanctioned labs doing fundamental exploration. Then we get to resource issues - labor isn't free, but you're not a funding agency. Want to elicit cost sharing, but if PB had incubator fund for first year, to help labs form (w/ understanding that labs &quot;home&quot; would have at least one-to-one matching) - could lead to sustainable model.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The Bamboo Program Document (drafts published March-April 2009) was a an outline for a possible 7-10 year vision for the Bamboo Community, discussed at Workshop 4.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;The Bamboo Program Document (drafts published March-April 2009) was a an outline for a possible 7-10 year vision for the Bamboo Community, discussed at Workshop 4.&quot;&gt;Program Document&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Section 5, Q&amp;A, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mith.umd.edu/mithstaff/#neilfraistat&quot;&gt;Neil Freistat&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: &quot;Important factor in expressing a view [about whether to &quot;ratify&quot; the Bamboo proposal] is the financial viability of the project. Amount of money that projects like this receive from &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The Bamboo Planning Project received funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation's Research in Information Technology Program (RIT), led by Ira Fuchs and Chris Mackie. The Bamboo Implementation Proposal was refined with that program in mind, but RIT was terminated before the proposal was funded.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;The Bamboo Planning Project received funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation's Research in Information Technology Program (RIT), led by Ira Fuchs and Chris Mackie. The Bamboo Implementation Proposal was refined with that program in mind, but RIT was terminated before the proposal was funded.&quot;&gt;Mellon&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will be less. There are some proposals for scale of fees from different institutions, contribution in kind, etc. Do you have some back-of-envelope calculations (that you might not be willing to share yet), but do you have ballpark ideas about how much resources would need to be available?&quot; &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Chad J. Kainz, Senior Director for Academic Technologies in Networking Services &amp; Information Technologies at the University of Chicago (later, Asst. Chief IT Officer and Executive Director, Campus &amp; Academic Services in IT Services) was a Co-Director and subsequently Principal Investigator for the Bamboo Planning Project.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Chad J. Kainz, Senior Director for Academic Technologies in Networking Services &amp; Information Technologies at the University of Chicago (later, Asst. Chief IT Officer and Executive Director, Campus &amp; Academic Services in IT Services) was a Co-Director and subsequently Principal Investigator for the Bamboo Planning Project.&quot;&gt;Chad Kainz&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: &quot;This is why trajectories are important; the more things we do, the smaller the money for each. Fee/leadership structure: idea is that it goes into supporting community and activity there, so we can focus grant funding on projects, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Major Areas of Work; the section of the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal that addressed what Bamboo would do (scholarly networking, atlas, services platform, community). Discussed at workshop 5.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Major Areas of Work; the section of the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal that addressed what Bamboo would do (scholarly networking, atlas, services platform, community). Discussed at workshop 5.&quot;&gt;MAoW&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Overhead of running Bamboo could otherwise eat up grant funds. &quot;Can we do this? Can we do this in the first year?&quot; Adjust scope as necessary due to funding resources.&quot; &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;David Greenbaum, Director of Data Services at the University of California, Berkeley, was a Co-Director of the Bamboo Planning Project.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;David Greenbaum, Director of Data Services at the University of California, Berkeley, was a Co-Director of the Bamboo Planning Project.&quot;&gt;David Greenbaum&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: &quot;We're not trying to hide anything; first round of institutional conversations was to get a sense of things; we know from &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The Bamboo Planning Project received funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation's Research in Information Technology Program (RIT), led by Ira Fuchs and Chris Mackie. The Bamboo Implementation Proposal was refined with that program in mind, but RIT was terminated before the proposal was funded.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;The Bamboo Planning Project received funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation's Research in Information Technology Program (RIT), led by Ira Fuchs and Chris Mackie. The Bamboo Implementation Proposal was refined with that program in mind, but RIT was terminated before the proposal was funded.&quot;&gt;Mellon&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; what they're holding. If it's a successful proposal, and financial world doesn't change again, they're holding about a million dollars per year for the next several years as investment for Bamboo. High-priority project for them. Pushing us on building and doing and constructing something that could be of value for many universities. Institutional conversations: people's general ability to stay involved, and what that looks like. Presume we have 25-30 institutions staying involved even in a minor way, hopefully a number in a significant way -- those are 2 resource pools. Berkeley/Chicago are committed, but we also have financial situation to deal with. Trying to look at total pool, what it'll be, use that as factor to adjust the work. We want to scale down from what we had in program document, scale down further here, figure out most important things. Did rough calculations a month or two ago, but even in last month, for some institutions things have gotten tighter. Could we be in a situation where we could have (this is rough), total resources of $3 mil per year? Maybe it's more? Leadership role - 2 programmers, more, could equal $250k itself-- not a lot of people were able/willing to make that commitment yet. What that will total up to be, how that can be shifted around, we need to figure this out. We need to get best thoughts for what's really important, and use that to prioritize. Things have gotten harder for us re: resources.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;W5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Daily Agenda, Q&amp;A)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;If [Bamboo Services Platform] succeeds in helping humanities and NEH get a better, bigger buy-in at federal level. Our funding is a &quot;rounding error&quot; on the scientists' funding. That's the value assigned to us.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;W5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Open Discussion: &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The section of the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal that addressed what Bamboo would do (scholarly networking, atlas, services platform, community). Discussed at workshop 5.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;The section of the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal that addressed what Bamboo would do (scholarly networking, atlas, services platform, community). Discussed at workshop 5.&quot;&gt;Major Areas of Work&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Services Platform)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Concern re: governance and other things - any external funding would be eaten by administration. How do we minimize that? Membership fees: financial investment and resource investment. Fees = what does it take for us to sustain this community? Workshop(s). Outreach, coordination, contest idea, that takes resources. Potentially in the future, as services platform comes up, eventually you have to pay for technology underneath these things for them to run. Membership fees look at sustaining/maintaining Bamboo as a community moving forward. Members: student enrollment of 3500 or less: $6000/yr + $9k equal resource investment; over 3500, $8k/$12k ERI. Affiliates: non-profit: $6k/$9k ERI. Commercial, for profit, up to $2.5m; $8k/$12k ERI. Commercial, for profit, over $2.5m; $10k/$15k ERI. Looked at Sakai for the commercial rates. Leadership requires an additional financial/ERI requirement. Don't have anything for financial model for this at this point. Idea is for leadership part to focus in on project management/coordination across all different projects. Trying to keep overhead to a minimum.

&lt;p&gt;Q: &quot;If you want larger to be 50% larger than smaller, math isn't quite right. Leadership role = a lot more investment. Why charge a leader added fees? It's a disincentive.

&lt;p&gt;Q: &quot;From a timing standpoint, first year is Jan 1 - value of PB doesn't kick in for some point down the road. A lot of other projects, you don't pay up-front. Until you see what it is.

Want to add in something - point of reference/comparison - Kuali Student. Modeled some of planning process on it. Early on they said that each leader has to put up a million dollars a year-- who's in? Took almost opposite approach-- put up a big number, got 5-6 institutions, that was it. We wanted to get the right kind of community, different areas and diversity of institutions from the start, but right now we need people who can/will carry a heavier load. Now, what's the right shape of that? Especially with amorphous result re: when/what.&quot; &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Chad J.

If you read original proposal, were supposed to fill half the room. Figured 7 institutions left standing; there's about 25 still here. A lot of things here coming from phonecalls - what are people willing to do, what can they do. Creative thinking about structuring PB participation in other ways.

Want something that'll do the right things to keep the activity of PB moving forward even if we hit sin wave things where things aren't going on. feedback/thoughts/ideas/comments, we appreciate them.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We've tried to bring this up, fundamental to PB model is that there has to be investment at institutional level from start for this to succeed or it's not sustainable as an overall project or locally.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;OU - it's easier to get contribution in kind (esp for staff) than to get authorization of cash payment.

&lt;p&gt;Q: &quot;From perspective of large state university, FY11 could be terrible, horrible; if I said to dean, all I need is $8k for Bamboo, he would give me counterstories about other units in the college right now who all need money, why would this be more important? Easy answers in the past are when &quot;we'll be doing work that will bring money back in&quot;. That will be the easiest way to have memberships-- schools doing part of the work, so funding is going back into them.

&lt;p&gt;Q: Looking at these numbers, I come from a R1 institution, but our endowment is small. Seems like in-kind is low. I can make cases for more in-kind. Cash contribution - CIO will say &quot;so what're you not going to do&quot;.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Cost structure - talking with other small arts college folks, might be easier to make things match rather than separate for yearly investment. If I said &quot;we're all paying $8k&quot; rather than &quot;we're paying $6k, they're paying $8k&quot;.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;W5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Open Discussion: Governance, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.educause.edu/Community/MemDir/Profiles/RickPeterson/54437&quot;&gt;Rick Peterson&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: &quot;Coming from multi-institution w/ Cal State system; would this count for all of CSU's, or each one. Can we get a bulk deal? In-kind contribution is much easier than cash; can do a lot of in-kind fund-raising.&quot; Q: &quot;Similarly - if membership is institutional, this raises tricky questions about schools and divisions w/in institution. Don't want to say free-rider, but there's internal and external free-riders. Maybe large institutions need to see if the case can't be made to involve other divisions.&quot; Q: &quot;We'll have to sort that out w/in our own institutions. No Oxford pot of money, there's lots of departments and sub-divisions. Argument that we want to be part of this project because of potential spin-offs and other projects that can be built on this platform. Humanities computing project can say they're part of Bamboo - good for visibility.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;W5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Open Discussion: Governance)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;How easy is it to get a hold of this amount of money, who pays it, how to get in-kind contributions - this is different for everyone. Advantage of cash contribution is that it's easy to cheat and fake on contribution in-kind (&quot;let's call this an in-kind because it's sorta related&quot;). Easy to not really get places on-board if they can just say &quot;oh yeah, this is Bamboo&quot;. Cash requires work of persuading people.

Also actively looking at that -- not necessarily building The One Thing but capability to do many things. As different needs come up, there's opportunities for connecting.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Lateral to issue of community, but relevant to it - in discussion yesterday, consciously slipped out of discussing the second category of payment that you had in there, for the leadership component; it was there in the diagram, but it wasn't taken up or developed. Seeing it in terms of payment is a problem. Have an idea that what is going to exist in long term is 2 levels: consortium, and membership. Consortium: those institutions who have resources (computational, financial, etc) to be the building blocks if you get a structure going. Don't want to make that criteria for using it, being a member. Asking, do you have local resources/service you want to put towards Bamboo? Heading towards that. Do you need to build that into the structure you're doing; then it begins to answer what the community is. A community necessary to work hard together, keep service agreements, and a community that are just paying as members. These people will really be a community, because they'll be an active network. Then there's the wider issue of it being open to everyone.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;W5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Open Discussion: Bamboo Community)&lt;/p&gt;

So program officers who present this to board understand what's going on, how to appropriately represent. Clarifying points, addressing issues. Having these conversations and feedback on drafts at workshops-- when we present drafts, we can say &quot;look, it's been community design&quot;. Important to capture this as part of the story of the planning process.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;At Workshop 5 (June 17 - 19, 2009), participants discussed the draft Bamboo Implementation Proposal and the consortial model, and voted to ratify the proposed major areas of work.&quot;&gt;W5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Open Discussion: Bamboo Community)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
