&lt;p&gt;&quot;&quot;Appropriate&quot; would be a less-kind way of naming the activity of citation. Position one's research in the context of the secondary literature. Establishes context for your scholarly activity; creates a research space; demonstrates authority via awareness of foregoing scholarly work&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Exploring Scholarly Practice: &quot; during=&quot;&quot; a=&quot;&quot; really=&quot;&quot; good=&quot;&quot; day=&quot;&quot; term=&quot;&quot; research=&quot;&quot; cycle=&quot;&quot; etc.=&quot;&quot; what=&quot;&quot; productive=&quot;&quot; things=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; relation=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; humanities=&quot;&quot; how=&quot;&quot; accomplish=&quot;&quot; that=&quot;&quot; task=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Exploring Scholarly Practice: &quot; during=&quot;&quot; a=&quot;&quot; really=&quot;&quot; good=&quot;&quot; day=&quot;&quot; term=&quot;&quot; research=&quot;&quot; cycle=&quot;&quot; etc.=&quot;&quot; what=&quot;&quot; productive=&quot;&quot; things=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; relation=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; humanities=&quot;&quot; how=&quot;&quot; accomplish=&quot;&quot; that=&quot;&quot; task=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 2&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1a (Berkeley; April 28-30, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1a (Berkeley; April 28-30, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1a&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-F)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;looking at ways we can do citations in distributed systems in ways that are available not just to scholars but to code working on aggregations&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Exploring Scholarly Practice: &quot; during=&quot;&quot; a=&quot;&quot; really=&quot;&quot; good=&quot;&quot; day=&quot;&quot; term=&quot;&quot; research=&quot;&quot; cycle=&quot;&quot; etc.=&quot;&quot; what=&quot;&quot; productive=&quot;&quot; things=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; relation=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; humanities=&quot;&quot; how=&quot;&quot; accomplish=&quot;&quot; that=&quot;&quot; task=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Exploring Scholarly Practice: &quot; during=&quot;&quot; a=&quot;&quot; really=&quot;&quot; good=&quot;&quot; day=&quot;&quot; term=&quot;&quot; research=&quot;&quot; cycle=&quot;&quot; etc.=&quot;&quot; what=&quot;&quot; productive=&quot;&quot; things=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; relation=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; humanities=&quot;&quot; how=&quot;&quot; accomplish=&quot;&quot; that=&quot;&quot; task=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 2&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1d&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-F)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;'Sense-making' is so fundamental to humanities scholarship ... but still Bamboo might provide a decoration of responsibility-trails and accountability for data and analysis in humanities scholarship.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking a Commonality: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Unpacking a Commonality: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;/5, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Tendency of technologically mediated sources &gt; more bite-sized pieces. When talking about issues of research process, this kind of issue becomes important re: workflow. Important to be able to share representation you're using. Not implicit in the same way. Citing electronic resources differently; move around differently&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking a Commonality: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Unpacking a Commonality: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1c&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-D)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;the intellectual property that informs research and thinking, but cannot be cited directly within the publication&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking a Commonality: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Unpacking a Commonality: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1d&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-C)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Citation tree, &quot;Great Eskimo Hoax&quot; (100 words for snow) traced down to a single statement. Who cites this scholar in relation to this set of vocabulary? Is there something we can contribute to focus on reliable information? As a scholar, you do that. Weeding out is a practice. You can get false associations. &quot;Was this review useful to you?&quot; - &quot;No, he got this totally wrong.&quot; Electronic posting; next user can find that and comment too. Being able to distinguish peer-reviewed content. Idea of finding and identifying the antecedents of a work. Genetic concept of scholarship&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking a Commonality: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Unpacking a Commonality: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1d&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-E)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You want to start by reading the &quot;important stuff&quot;. How do you define important? Is the &quot;cited a lot&quot; algorithm enough? It might be the reverse - an inverse citation analysis? Ideally, it'd allow me to tell it what it should look for. I might be saying &quot;ignore citation, look for frequency where things are mentioned&quot;. User-customizable and trainable so you develop your own profile. Suddenly tell it &quot;But today, I want citation heavy!&quot; Not new connections, necessarily, but relevant to what you want to do. Just find them, and I'll decide what's important. Citation works for some things, he's got different needs on different days. Need something that's morphable over time, software that works with you to define different metrics&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking a Commonality: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Unpacking a Commonality: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1d&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-E)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;citation of unusual/nontraditional materials. e.g. some stuff on an island in Second Life&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking the Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Unpacking the Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-B)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you made it accessible socially and could get citation credit for someone else using it, does it make the benefit higher? If they could use their annotation. Rarely does credit trickle down to individuals who do the work. Being 26th is great, but it's mostly pain for first 25. If Bamboo can change the cost side of that-- benefit side is real but weak, so uncertain. Sent me reviewer comments, &quot;she hasn't done a lot of scholarship, her work has been archival&quot;. Say nice things about people who do archival work, but don't give them tenure and don't mind if they don't do it. If we could get rewarded for those kinds of things in a systematic way, more people might do it. &quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking the Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Unpacking the Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1c&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-D)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If there isn't an impediment to digitization, how do you cross-reference. How do you make it functional? How do you cross-reference digital with folders? How do you maintain that to find what you need?

It is repository indepdendent being able to reference resources used via persistent URIs and in accord with bibliographic citation standards.

It will be able to ingest resources without regard to brand or location of repository and will generate value criteria that persist and are themselves referenceable and utilizable in research.&quot; (Tools &amp; Content Partners working group, Thought Ark Demonstrator, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.matei.org/&quot;&gt;Sorin Matei&lt;/a&gt;, 12/8/08)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The lists of citations stored on the [Thought Ark] platform should be downloadable as APA/MLA/Chicago-formatted reference lists. Furthermore, when used in conjunction with a web-based word processor, such as tinyMCE, the lists can be inserted as citations in academic papers. In effect, the system combines the function of a versatile, socially-networked search engine with that of a typical reference management system, like Endnote. Unlike EndNote or Zotero, the system is completely webcentric and it combines social networking and publishing in the same package. The later feature should be of great interest for the faculty and the instructors since it facilitates their research work in a direct way. This creates the premises for attracting the instructors to the system, which will represent a tremendous asset for enhancing the value of the relevance criteria.&quot; (Tools &amp; Content Partners working group, Thought Ark Demonstrator, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.matei.org/&quot;&gt;Sorin Matei&lt;/a&gt;, 12/8/08)&lt;/p&gt;

In additon, the current method of creating and updating entries and adding linked resources is not geared to collaborative, distributed building of the register and the sharing of knowledge by the wider community who use the register. A set of shared services is needed for creating and updating entries, classifying them and associating them with other entities and resources; also for finding or harvesting and seeding entries with information discovered in other collections and for linking to entities in other collections (for example Australian men or men and women from other countries who might have a relationship with an Australian woman described in the register).

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The simplified, contrived scenario used in this demonstrator postulates a student doing research for a paper which will include a discussion of the tragic 1903 fire which destroyed the Iroquois Theater in Chicago, killed 600 individuals, and resulted in the closing of all theaters in Chicago for a period of time. Through the Digital Library Federation's American Social History Online portal, the student discovers a high-quality digital version of a photo taken the day after the fire. The student wants not only to reference the photo in his research paper (the photo is owned and was digitized by the Library of Congress), he also wants to manipulate the high-resolution, uncompressed TIFF image file to crop and zoom in on a specific region of the photograph to include in his paper. He wants to be able to provide URIs for both the cropped region of the photograph (i.e., the image fragment) he creates and for the source Library of Congress image from which the image fragment he puts in his paper was derived. He does not have on his desktop any software that can manipulate the original TIFF, nor does he have a Web server at hand on which he could mount the generated image fragment, even if he could create it on his own. By exploiting the technologies mentioned above and by some mildly tedious manual cutting and pasting, the student is able to achieve the desired end-result; however, clearly the process could be more seamless and more automated. A five and a half minute video clip has been created showing how the student might go about his task using currently available technology and content. However, while the made-up scenario outlined above can be demonstrated today for a selection of digital content on the Web, a lot of things have to work just right. Many digital content providers do not provide asset action URIs (or the equivalent) pointing to best resolution image files they hold, or do not disseminate same in an OAI-ORE Resource Map. Nor is most digital content described by rich, MODS bibliographic records (facilitating reference in accord with bibliographic standards). The Zotero translator used in this illustration is custom, experimental and not in wide circulation. And while the Djatoka tool as available for download from Los Alamos is quite robust and can do much more than just crop and zoom, it may be useful to create additional service wrappers to help integrate this tool into additional scholarly workflows. In particular, there seems good potential for benefit by implementing a service layer for batch processing of aggregations or collections of images using Djatoka. Additional standards and best practices are needed to encourage more scholarly high-level exploitation, manipulation, and re-use of digital images.&quot; (Tools &amp; Content Partners working group, Djatoka-based image cropping demonstrator, 1/9/09)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Characteristic of memography: Citation: A memography contains citations between statements and the evidence on which they are based. A memography differs from a traditional monograph because in a memography we know that authors have only been able to scrutinize a subset of the evidence cited. Citations in a memography include versioned queries: we can thus see what evidence was available at the time when the memography was completed and how that evidence has subsequently changed as new sources come on-line, existing analytical tools become more powerful or wholly new services emerge.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Scholarly Narratives emerged from W2, describing or exemplifying practices, work, tools and collaboration the community believed should impact and should be impacted by the work of Project Bamboo.
