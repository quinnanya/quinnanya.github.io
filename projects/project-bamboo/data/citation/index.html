<p>"Citation tree, "Great Eskimo Hoax" (100 words for snow) traced down to a single statement. Who cites this scholar in relation to this set of vocabulary? Is there something we can contribute to focus on reliable information? As a scholar, you do that. Weeding out is a practice. You can get false associations. "Was this review useful to you?" - "No, he got this totally wrong." Electronic posting; next user can find that and comment too. Being able to distinguish peer-reviewed content. Idea of finding and identifying the antecedents of a work.

<p>"You want to start by reading the "important stuff". How do you define important? Is the "cited a lot" algorithm enough? It might be the reverse - an inverse citation analysis? Ideally, it'd allow me to tell it what it should look for. I might be saying "ignore citation, look for frequency where things are mentioned". User-customizable and trainable so you develop your own profile. Suddenly tell it "But today, I want citation heavy!" Not new connections, necessarily, but relevant to what you want to do. Just find them, and I'll decide what's important. Citation works for some things, he's got different needs on different days. Need something that's morphable over time, software that works with you to define different metrics" (<span class="glossary-term" title="Unpacking a Commonality: " what="" discrete="" practices="" are="" involved="" in="" these="" themes="" outstanding="" issues="" need="" to="" be="" addressed="" regards=""><abbr title="Unpacking a Commonality: " what="" discrete="" practices="" are="" involved="" in="" these="" themes="" outstanding="" issues="" need="" to="" be="" addressed="" regards="">Ex 4</abbr></span>, <span class="glossary-term" title="Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier."><abbr title="Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.">1d</abbr></span>-E)</p>

<p>"If you made it accessible socially and could get citation credit for someone else using it, does it make the benefit higher? If they could use their annotation. Rarely does credit trickle down to individuals who do the work. Being 26th is great, but it's mostly pain for first 25. If Bamboo can change the cost side of that-- benefit side is real but weak, so uncertain. Sent me reviewer comments, "she hasn't done a lot of scholarship, her work has been archival". Say nice things about people who do archival work, but don't give them tenure and don't mind if they don't do it.

<p>"With materials in parallel format, people cite the print format more than the electronic format, because it's perceived as "better".

<p>"Thought Ark re-purpose and manipulate digital resources in that it creates value out of their usage patterns.  It is repository indepdendent being able to reference resources used via persistent URIs and in accord with bibliographic citation standards. It will also create a standard of sorts, that will support interoperability and integration. It will be able to ingest resources without regard to brand or location of repository and will generate value criteria that persist and are themselves referenceable and utilizable in research."

<p>"The lists of citations stored on the [Thought Ark] platform should be downloadable as APA/MLA/Chicago-formatted reference lists. Furthermore, when used in conjunction with a web-based word processor, such as tinyMCE, the lists can be inserted as citations in academic papers. In effect, the system combines the function of a versatile, socially-networked search engine with that of a typical reference management system, like Endnote. Unlike EndNote or Zotero, the system is completely webcentric and it combines social networking and publishing in the same package. The later feature should be of great interest for the faculty and the instructors since it facilitates their research work in a direct way. This creates the premises for attracting the instructors to the system, which will represent a tremendous asset for enhancing the value of the relevance criteria."

<p>"This is the story of the Australian Women's Register, a major project of Australian Women's Archives Project. The register, an online database: collects and aggregates information about women, their roles in Australian society, and the resources in which their activities are documented; Acts as an all-in-one biographical dictionary, women's studies encyclopaedia/compendium, annotated bibliography and guide to records; Supports research, teaching and learning, and community engagement. See: <a href="http://www.womenaustralia.info/browse.htm" title="http://www.womenaustralia.info/browse.htm">http://www.womenaustralia.info/browse.htm</a> The register was started in 2000 and is an ongoing collaborative project that aims to continue and develop into the future as a perpetual resource of enduring value for scholars and the community more generally. identification and resolution, both for resources and entities, and the availability of structured information about entities and resources that can be interchanged between systems. In additon, the current method of creating and updating entries and adding linked resources is not geared to collaborative, distributed building of the register and the sharing of knowledge by the wider community who use the register. A set of shared services is needed for creating and updating entries, classifying them and associating them with other entities and resources; also for finding or harvesting and seeding entries with information discovered in other collections and for linking to entities in other collections (for example Australian men or men and women from other countries who might have a relationship with an Australian woman described in the register). Also for enabling the implementation of appropriate trust models that support the moderation of entries and annotations."

<p>"The simplified, contrived scenario used in this demonstrator postulates a student doing research for a paper which will include a discussion of the tragic 1903 fire which destroyed the Iroquois Theater in Chicago, killed 600 individuals, and resulted in the closing of all theaters in Chicago for a period of time. Through the Digital Library Federation's American Social History Online portal, the student discovers a high-quality digital version of a photo taken the day after the fire. The student wants not only to reference the photo in his research paper (the photo is owned and was digitized by the Library of Congress), he also wants to manipulate the high-resolution, uncompressed TIFF image file to crop and zoom in on a specific region of the photograph to include in his paper. He wants to be able to provide URIs for both the cropped region of the photograph (i.e., the image fragment) he creates and for the source Library of Congress image from which the image fragment he puts in his paper was derived. He does not have on his desktop any software that can manipulate the original TIFF, nor does he have a Web server at hand on which he could mount the generated image fragment, even if he could create it on his own. By exploiting the technologies mentioned above and by some mildly tedious manual cutting and pasting, the student is able to achieve the desired end-result; however, clearly the process could be more seamless and more automated. A five and a half minute video clip has been created showing how the student might go about his task using currently available technology and content. However, while the made-up scenario outlined above can be demonstrated today for a selection of digital content on the Web, a lot of things have to work just right. Many digital content providers do not provide asset action URIs (or the equivalent) pointing to best resolution image files they hold, or do not disseminate same in an OAI-ORE Resource Map. Nor is most digital content described by rich, MODS bibliographic records (facilitating reference in accord with bibliographic standards). The Zotero translator used in this illustration is custom, experimental and not in wide circulation. And while the Djatoka tool as available for download from Los Alamos is quite robust and can do much more than just crop and zoom, it may be useful to create additional service wrappers to help integrate this tool into additional scholarly workflows. In particular, there seems good potential for benefit by implementing a service layer for batch processing of aggregations or collections of images using Djatoka. Additional standards and best practices are needed to encourage more scholarly high-level exploitation, manipulation, and re-use of digital images."

<p>"Characteristic of memography: Citation: A memography contains citations between statements and the evidence on which they are based. A memography differs from a traditional monograph because in a memography we know that authors have only been able to scrutinize a subset of the evidence cited. Citations in a memography include versioned queries: we can thus see what evidence was available at the time when the memography was completed and how that evidence has subsequently changed as new sources come on-line, existing analytical tools become more powerful or wholly new services emerge."
