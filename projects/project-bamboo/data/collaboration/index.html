Need to setup effective communication channels and communities - often not technical. Have to set up meeting to come together, listen to each other; listen to the same text together.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Bamboo needs to take into account interdisciplinary work and how this changes the process, the people one needs to engage with, the dissolution of institutional boundaries, etc. What does collaboration in research mean? What tools are needed? We have experimented with Sakai and others - could these be developed further to support &quot;collaborative research.&quot; What I observed is a group of people, with common purpose or interest that pull together data, manuscripts, whatever (content) and then there is a conversation around the set of content they've pulled together which leads to new chunks of content to be added in. Then there are uncommon practices - those with big bodies of text might want to apply tools to linguistic analysis while others might want to do statistical work (e.g. need unit level census data to analyze the impact of fasting on health in Indonesia).&quot; (&lt;span are=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; common=&quot;&quot; emerged=&quot;&quot; exploration=&quot;&quot; from=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; of=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; scholarly=&quot;&quot; that=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Common and Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; your=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr are=&quot;&quot; common=&quot;&quot; emerged=&quot;&quot; exploration=&quot;&quot; from=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; of=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; scholarly=&quot;&quot; that=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Common and Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; your=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 3&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1d&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-E)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;early television (for which there's little text), he deploys traditional oral history, which produces a context in which you need to think about those methodologies in rigorous ways, as a dialogic exchange what-have-you with the rights of someone to represent themselves, etc. It can lead to some values of research that lie outside the box, or which aren't typically articulated. the oral history itself becomes a text that you work to produce but which someone else has a claim on as well. so what you do with it after that could be something traditional (e.g. paper or book) but you could also go back to the person you interviewed and have them comment on it. the tools we're talking about and the significance of user participation can lead to a more dialogic product, and those exchanges can lead somewhere interesting&quot; (&lt;span are=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking the Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr are=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking the Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-B)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;had one of those moments: he was working with urban Appalachians, had been documenting one guy's house, didn't have a wide-angle lens, tried to capture interiors... urban Appalachians live in bourgeois houses but in a nonbourgeois way. this guy offered to take pictures of his house for the scholar. the scholar wrote a piece about the structures of this guy's videotape and of the house, which informed each other. the idea of the subject of study speaking back goes back to a broader idea where the study itself is reflexive, there is a general ethos about the significance of being reflexive in your methodology&quot; (&lt;span are=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking the Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr are=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking the Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-B)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Cross organizational boundaries (little respect for organizational boundaries). Blur personal/work life - hours of work not fixed. Less dedication/loyalty to organization.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;social component is huge. social networking &amp; social connections play a larger role. facebook popular with save minority languages movements, find events. merger of graduate work and social movements --&gt; departments find themselves admiring and responding to these changes. not a wide-eyed trend, more of a cynical/suspicious. ability to communicate with one another. does take people away from the library.... some amount of solo work is required -- books to read, films to watch closely. tendency to work on multiple facets independently. humanists somewhat dispirited if they're working in areas that don't have this open, sociable, interaction&quot; (&lt;span at=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; graduate=&quot;&quot; look=&quot;&quot; new-hires=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; students=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Identify Future Scholarly Practices: &quot; up-and-coming=&quot;&quot; when=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr at=&quot;&quot; graduate=&quot;&quot; look=&quot;&quot; new-hires=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; students=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Identify Future Scholarly Practices: &quot; up-and-coming=&quot;&quot; when=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 6a&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-A)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Technology allows the &quot;subversives&quot; among staff (often young) to subvert slow-moving, slow-changing organizations. At least some younger faculty and grad students are participating and paying attention to these changes.&quot; (&lt;span at=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; graduate=&quot;&quot; look=&quot;&quot; new-hires=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; students=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Identify Future Scholarly Practices: &quot; up-and-coming=&quot;&quot; when=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr at=&quot;&quot; graduate=&quot;&quot; look=&quot;&quot; new-hires=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; students=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Identify Future Scholarly Practices: &quot; up-and-coming=&quot;&quot; when=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 6a&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-B)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;More of a &quot;groupness&quot; sense among younger students/scholars. Swarming behaviors. Comfort with group, not so frequent an occurrence of solo scholars. It seems technology has to do with that. Age development issue among undergraduates ... many incoming freshmen haven't yet learned to work in groups. A social, not a technology issue.&quot; (&lt;span at=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; graduate=&quot;&quot; look=&quot;&quot; new-hires=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; students=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Identify Future Scholarly Practices: &quot; up-and-coming=&quot;&quot; when=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr at=&quot;&quot; graduate=&quot;&quot; look=&quot;&quot; new-hires=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; students=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Identify Future Scholarly Practices: &quot; up-and-coming=&quot;&quot; when=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 6a&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-B)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;New colleagues are networking heavily on many different listserves, far less archival, far more interdisciplinary, just scholars - lots of new combinations of things.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;When we asked &quot;how do you learn&quot; you could see a clear change between ugrad and grad -- they learn from each other -- and advanced/faculty -- they are apprenticed into the discipline and learn from predecessors and masters.&quot; (&lt;span at=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; graduate=&quot;&quot; look=&quot;&quot; new-hires=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; students=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Identify Future Scholarly Practices: &quot; up-and-coming=&quot;&quot; when=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr at=&quot;&quot; graduate=&quot;&quot; look=&quot;&quot; new-hires=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; students=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Identify Future Scholarly Practices: &quot; up-and-coming=&quot;&quot; when=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 6a&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1c&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-A)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Also observed that among undergraduates [18-21] learning styles are different. Much more group/p2p learning, less master-student learning.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;The interdisciplinarity of younger scholars and desire to crossover is striking. Range of things younger scholars are expecting to do is increasing. Changing what they'll do on the job market. Only experience is in interdisciplinary areas. Continually attempting to draw students into interdisciplinarity, though it's becoming increasingly easier as students want to do this on their own. Students looking to work interdisciplanarily without needing to be pushed.&quot; (&lt;span at=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; graduate=&quot;&quot; look=&quot;&quot; new-hires=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; students=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Identify Future Scholarly Practices: &quot; up-and-coming=&quot;&quot; when=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr at=&quot;&quot; graduate=&quot;&quot; look=&quot;&quot; new-hires=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; students=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Identify Future Scholarly Practices: &quot; up-and-coming=&quot;&quot; when=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 6a&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1c&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-B)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Social learning space links into collaboration space -People want to collaborate, but have to have a space and the library can provide that.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;they're more attuned to social networking software than &quot;we&quot; are. they update their profiles better, share their activities with their community. &quot;community&quot;? internal/departmental community; often don't see each other often. friend networks, peers from college... 30-45 age range is now coming into the networks, people start to express their professional persona.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Grad student practices - we have 3 areas of expertise: visual culture, museum culture, and mapping. Produce creative theses, have to do a dissertation, but also produce a film (visual anthropologists) but we came up to limits of our digital facilities. Electric installation art - have to write about it but also produce one himself. Problems: creating his piece of art, depends on audience interaction. Found it difficult to accommodate every dimension of that w/ in a video context. Sought all kinds of expertise but existing resources didn't enable him to produce a thesis w/ all elements.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;A way to help digital humanists find each other - how many people say to themselves &quot;I'm a digital humanist&quot;. Is the fact that they use digital technology key to what they're doing, or are they humanists, and they're in a particular thing, and the digital is a modus operandi. Maybe it wouldn't be so much about introspection about identity, but &quot;I'm a humanist, this has value to me, I'll jump into it.&quot; &quot;Digital humanities&quot; is going to be the future, it'll be assumed after a while.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;With the economic situation (and environmental concerns for our carbon footprints), people will have to travel less to professional conferences. What kinds of facilities can Bamboo create or offer to substitute for travel? We need to try to get ahead of the game on this, especially for international conferences. We need to find solutions and models that work. How can you get all the informal aspects of a conference, not only the formal presentations, papers, and Q&amp;A sessions? This can also apply to research work groups - as in her field of 19th century poetry - getting scholars together for workshops, digital or virtual - we need to find out what works here. (Example of MLA discussion groups, but highly interactive.) The emphasis is on collaboration and collaborative research, need specific technologies for different collaborative styles and preferences (workshops, conferences, etc), not a universal, one-size-fits all.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Extending the influential work of British cultural studies scholar Raymond Williams and his Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society (1976), Burgett and Hendler consider a keyword as much more than a term providing access to existing sources of information. Instead their volume focuses on the ways in which the historical and contemporary uses of specific words create nodal points in many of today's most critical debates about political and social life, revealing often overlooked connections among different kinds of cultural research, both inside and outside of the academy. Collaboration is the keyword of these efforts. The volume and the website that accompanies it engage readers and participants as makers of meaning, asking them to revise, reject, and respond to the entries that do and do not appear in the volume. The point is that the discussions presented in the volume need to remain open to further elaboration and amendment. That's essential to any problem-based understanding of how research is conducted and how knowledge is made, either inside or outside academic settings. The ultimate goal is for readers to move through critique by adding or making something new. That thing can be as minor as a new conversation or classroom assignment or as major as an edited volume, digital archive, or public initiative. Using embedded wiki technology, the keywords collaboratories are the centerpiece of the website. They allow groups of users to compose and revise their keywords entries as part of a class assignment or working group project. Sample assignments are available on the site and rhe resulting entries may be submitted to Burgett and Hendler for publication there. These types of assignments - ones with a meaningful publication that circulates beyond the walls of the classroom - ups the ante for students and participants, who tend to learn more and to produce much better work as a consequence.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Scholarly Narratives emerged from W2, describing or exemplifying practices, work, tools and collaboration the community believed should impact and should be impacted by the work of Project Bamboo.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;I work with 3 Tele-Immersion labs (UC Berkeley, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, and UC Davis). We are a collection of computer engineers/scientists and dance artists working on the concept of distributed co-presence and immersion-based creativity. The resources that we are developing to share include: creating compatible Tele-Immersion labs at numerous cites and the sharing of Tele-immersion data collected during experiments and performances. The needs of this project are twofold and require technology. One: develop the actual physical TI laboratories are inherently about live communication between numerous users. Two: sharing of visual data and other information collected during experiments and performances that other artists and computer engineers can utilize to make new things, catalog, analyze, etc. This project has less to do with sharing of existing collections and tools and more to do with making new artistic and scientific artifacts (and discoveries around the creative process) using a new technology. What is missing from this project on a &quot;shared&quot; level are the following: more TI labs and connecting with other artists, humanists and social scientists, etc. who are also interested in digital performance, the digital body, TI, art making using distributed VR technology, etc. Basically letting other people know about the data that is being collected and the technology that is being developed and finding ways to collaborate with others interested in this new sphere of performance and virtual co-presence.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Scholarly Narratives emerged from W2, describing or exemplifying practices, work, tools and collaboration the community believed should impact and should be impacted by the work of Project Bamboo.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;I will often try to set up a a working group around an idea or project with a few grad students and colleagues. The colleagues might be at other institutions. These working groups are for new ideas for which we don't have grant funding to travel or pay for infrastructure to be set up. We need a mix of ways to communicate, share files, collaborate on writing grants. We need to be able to meet online regularly. We need to be able to set these up quickly and to be able to add communication tools as we need them. We need to be able to do this with a minimum of bureaucracy. We need to be able to close them down and archive stuff. Sometimes when we move we need to actually move the hair ball to another university.&lt;br /&gt;
How: Iterative scaling of a group research project&lt;br /&gt;
i. I meet Jean at a conference and we decide (over tea) that it would be neat to try a project together on X. She mentions she has a couple grad students who might be interested and I have a colleague.&lt;br /&gt;
ii. I get back and remembering the neat idea I e-mail her.&lt;br /&gt;
iii. We agree to look for funding and to do that we need to flesh out the idea. We bring on board the grad students. I ask for a discussion list to be set up. She creates a Google Document.&lt;br /&gt;
iv. We start iteratively writing the idea out.&lt;br /&gt;
v. We agree that we need to talk. Jean and I Skype, but then we can't include others. We can't afford to fly to meet so we decide to try some conferencing technology the campus is pushing. It is Elluminate this month. We book the room, get the account, figure it out. We use some online meeting organizer to find a common time. On the date I find that the local setup has been changed so Elluminate doesn't work because the Java libraries aren't right. My grad student e-mails the others while I try to find a technician. We find one and they fix the problem. The meeting is now late. But it sort of works.&lt;br /&gt;
vi. We agree that we need to give the project a name and a web presence especially since we got a little bit of money to run a half-day conference. I apply for an account on a research web server so my grad student can put up a simple web site.&lt;br /&gt;
Helps: Now I will do a number of things. I will apply for a discussion list (takes about 2 days to get permission and one set up.) I might apply to let people (at other universities) onto a wiki I have access to if we need shared writing space. Increasingly I have used Google Docs for shared documents. I have tried setting up a Ning group and that didn't work. I have also used Skype for one 2 one voice conferencing and Elluminate to try to do group to group conferencing. Skype works, but doesn't scale to groups. Elluminate with echo-canceling microphones sort of worked, but took a lot of support from staff. Access grid technology was beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;
Need: What I think I need is integration, better conferencing, and lower bureaucracy. I would like something a bit like Ning, but with Google Docs features and Skype-like conferencing. I would also like it to be simpler with the ability to turn things on as we go.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Internet provides unprecedented new ways of compiling and publishing this information [Catalogue Raisonné is &quot;a monograph giving a comprehensive catalogue of artworks by an artist&quot;] as a dynamic, collaborative, ongoing process. A seed catalogue containing known information, perhaps from an already well-documented collection or exhibition catalogue can provide a model for the entries and can form the basis for gathering new works and information. One of the important characteristics of this method of research is to make the seed catalogue discoverable on the Internet. This can be a potent way of attracting potential collaborators and also of enabling non-researchers - dealers, buyers, sellers and private collectors - to discover the project and contribute information on works they own or that have passed through their hands. Some may become researchers in their own right and contribute directly to the growing catalogue. Others may provide information via more traditional methods - letters, email, telephone discussions, visits. Support for a creative commons approach might be the default for this tool. However, there would need to be a minimum level of access control for inviting contributors and approving contributions. At some stage in the process, a version of the Catalogue Raisonné might still be published in the form of a high quality printed monograph.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Scholarly Narratives emerged from W2, describing or exemplifying practices, work, tools and collaboration the community believed should impact and should be impacted by the work of Project Bamboo.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;As well as providing support for funded research, at grass-roots level, there is a need for a simple open source cataloguing tool that could be deployed as part of a social networking website for use as a way of gathering the collective intelligence of enthusiasts not necessarily having any formal qualification as researchers. Oddly enough, blogging tools have some of the capabilities needed. My third example is a demonstrator I mocked up recently for a tiny community of collectors interested in the work of Gundars Lusis (Gunda: Australian Studio Pottery by Gundars Lusis, retrieved January 5, 2009 from &lt;a href=&quot;http://gundapottery.wordpress.com/&quot; title=&quot;http://gundapottery.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;http://gundapottery.wordpress.com/&lt;/a&gt;).

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;A researcher in an English department is studying metaphor in literary and non-literary texts. They approach the phenomenon from vaarious points of view and with various approaches. They are interested in describing the forms and functions of metaphors in texts, in identifying and classifying metaphors, and understanding what these findings can contribute to general theories of grammar, style and cognition. In order to conduct a more well-founded and intensive empirical study, the researcher sets up an international interest group, which selects a text, each individual identifies and categorises all metaphors in the text, and then they meet together (in one physical location) approximately once per year and compare and discuss their analyses, thus testing, refining and further developing the analytic scheme, and discussing the theoretical implications of their findings, as well as their problems and differneces. They publish regularly, individually, and (more rarely) in jointly authored papers. This has taken place over the past 10 years or so, and goes on. No external funding, or computational tools were necessary for this work, although the researchers realised that online collaborative analysis tools would make more of this work possible. In order to take things a step further, and to conduct a wider empirical study, allowing comparison of text genres, and some intimation of frequencies of metaphorical forms, the researcher decided to apply some corpus linguistic resources and methods. Significant external funding was acquired, a big team of graduate students hired, and corpus linguistics consultants co-opted. Together with the consultants, a small corpus (a subset of an existing standard reference corpus, using well-documented, standard formats) was adopted, and a formal system of tagging metaphors was devised, using well-documented standards (TEI). The consultants (including the current author) selected the corpus texts, devised the tagging formalism, adapted the corpus XML schema to incorporate the metaphor tags, indexed the corpus for an analysis tool (concordancer), and ran a training session for the project team (including IT support staff).&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Scholarly Narratives emerged from W2, describing or exemplifying practices, work, tools and collaboration the community believed should impact and should be impacted by the work of Project Bamboo.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;SCI Forge Group has been planning proposal to involve 5+ inter-generational groups. Teams might come up w/ proposals for study fo middle ages through visualization, or hemisphere of Americas through geospatial methods. Teams would specify what specifically they'd do, but all teams would have common goal of joint research environment (texts, tools, data sets) - documenting/rationalizing methodological decisions. During pilot phase - teams would also be associated w/ hum centers of both kinds that would host 3 face-to-face training sessions. Would have to commit to public lectures/programs related to research project/methods pursued by the team. Engaging local humanities community. Crucial element: inter-generational; senior/junior/post-doc/graduate students. Engaging w/ different stages, including not digitally expert, hope to socialize entire group in new research culture by asking everyone to contribute (or methodologocial commons) - foster dialogue for best methods for doing research job. Understanding use of tools. Allows junior scholars for getting credit for expertise, training younger generation of scholars. Knowledge gained/documented could be of use to scholars w/ similar problems. Take advantage of established d research environment.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;The rationale of the AUSTLANG project is that it provides, through public online access, a searchable research resource for as wide as possible a group of Australian and international researchers in the fields of linguistics, Australian Indigenous languages, anthropology, history, museology, ethnobotany, environmental studies and other disciplines. As well as being users of the resource, Australian Indigenous communities, as the source for the linguistic data, are central to the process. The website also allows for interaction with and contributions from users, including Indigenous researchers. AUSTLANG is a team project which involves many academics, public researchers, programmers and other technicians, and Australian Indigenous people. As the rationale of AUSTLANG is the provision of public online access to research materials, and this process is augmented by sophisticated search facilities, the project is already oriented towards &quot;shared services&quot;. The project could also potentially provide a web mapping service for other Australian Indigenous language projects, such as AUSTKIN, &lt;a href=&quot;http://austkin.pacific-credo.fr/index.php?page=home&quot; title=&quot;http://austkin.pacific-credo.fr/index.php?page=home&quot;&gt;http://austkin.pacific-credo.fr/index.php?page=home&lt;/a&gt; (See also &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Service&quot; title=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Service&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Service&lt;/a&gt;). It is also interactive, so users may themselves contribute to the resource. And the project is based on a collaboration between a research institute - the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) - and the Australian National University.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Scholarly Narratives emerged from W2, describing or exemplifying practices, work, tools and collaboration the community believed should impact and should be impacted by the work of Project Bamboo.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;In English and the Comparative History of Ideas at the UW, students are trained to examine and critique the ways in which technology is culturally embedded, how it influences aesthetics, and how it shapes our understanding of the humane. However, these same students rarely have the opportunity to learn the technical skills required to produce the very objects they study. In Geography at the UW, there is a similar trajectory, yet in nearly the opposite direction: students often learn technical skills in geographic information systems (GIS) without becoming well-versed in qualitative or critical GIS, fields that consider technology to be value-laden. As such, we are designing a digital humanities curriculum that asks undergraduates to approach the concept of &quot;mapping&quot; in the digital humanites from two different perspectives.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Scholarly Narratives emerged from W2, describing or exemplifying practices, work, tools and collaboration the community believed should impact and should be impacted by the work of Project Bamboo.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;&quot;Mapping&quot; ultimately became a hinge, if you will, between Sayers's and Wilson's approaches to technology. They found that they both used the term often, but almost always with different valences. Unpacking those valences and drawing affiliations across them thus functioned as means to better understand each other's disciplines, research, archives, and lexica. And from their ongoing conversations, Sayers and Wilson are also learning that it is not their shared technical skills or critical practices that are necessarily bridging their approaches and fields of study. Rather, that bridge is the continuing desire to seek novel forms of technoliteracy at the UW and elsewhere: to encourage creative thinking with and through technology, to animate existing histories and archives in new directions, to promote participatory learning climates, and (most importantly) to frame technology as neither determinant nor neutral.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Scholarly Narratives emerged from W2, describing or exemplifying practices, work, tools and collaboration the community believed should impact and should be impacted by the work of Project Bamboo.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Weeks later, a history professor at a research university who is an active scholar in the field of medieval cartography discovers TASE and is particularly interested&lt;br /&gt;
in the assistant professor's approach to Anglo-Saxon maps. Not knowing her scholarship, he studies her approach and feels it would be useful to include her perspective as a tool within his field's virtual research environment (VRE). So in accordance with the usage criteria she included with the TASE application when she published it into the Bamboo Community, he incorporates TASE (with citation) into his project's virtual research environment. His VRE allows faculty working on medieval cartography to share ideas, collaborate on projects, publish whitepapers, etc., but also allows researchers in the field to annotate and comment on materials. Because the virtual research environment is &quot;Bamboo aware&quot; and can incorporate Bamboo services, the history professor connects the TASE application service with the VRE's annotation service. Not long after creating &quot;annotated TASE,&quot; scholars begin to add comments to the timeline, use it as a basis for a series of discussions, and explore a research direction based on the assistant professor's approach captured within her application.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Scholarly Narratives emerged from W2, describing or exemplifying practices, work, tools and collaboration the community believed should impact and should be impacted by the work of Project Bamboo.
