        <p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Collecting primary sources. This might involve interviewing people and discovering grammars; Discovering grammar is metaphor, I'm interogating dead people.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Looking at physical archives is a richer experience due to serendipity of how one browses and finds.  When looking through an internet portal, one misses &quot;incidentally related&quot; materials.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Exploring Scholarly Practice: &quot; during=&quot;&quot; a=&quot;&quot; really=&quot;&quot; good=&quot;&quot; day=&quot;&quot; term=&quot;&quot; research=&quot;&quot; cycle=&quot;&quot; etc.=&quot;&quot; what=&quot;&quot; productive=&quot;&quot; things=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; relation=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; humanities=&quot;&quot; how=&quot;&quot; accomplish=&quot;&quot; that=&quot;&quot; task=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Exploring Scholarly Practice: &quot; during=&quot;&quot; a=&quot;&quot; really=&quot;&quot; good=&quot;&quot; day=&quot;&quot; term=&quot;&quot; research=&quot;&quot; cycle=&quot;&quot; etc.=&quot;&quot; what=&quot;&quot; productive=&quot;&quot; things=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; relation=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; humanities=&quot;&quot; how=&quot;&quot; accomplish=&quot;&quot; that=&quot;&quot; task=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 2&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-C)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;when doing literature searches may be biased toward electronic resources, away from print&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking a Commonality: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Unpacking a Commonality: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1d&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-D)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;To what extent are new folk replacing library search w. Google search? &quot;Huge&quot;. Frightening how exclusively people rely on Google. It's the first place people go (to Google). There's a reliance on electronic sources (Some young people have never seen book journals.) Students don't always understand the big investment U's pay for online journal access. To what extent are online journals a scholarly source for research? Authors are cited much more when journals are online. Not definitive. Need to disaggregate what's ref'ed for research versus teaching. In my field no one uses journals (technology field) because too old by the time it's published.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Identify Future Scholarly Practices: &quot; when=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; look=&quot;&quot; at=&quot;&quot; new-hires=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; up-and-coming=&quot;&quot; graduate=&quot;&quot; students=&quot;&quot; what=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; they=&quot;&quot; use=&quot;&quot; that=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; different=&quot;&quot; from=&quot;&quot; yours=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Identify Future Scholarly Practices: &quot; when=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; look=&quot;&quot; at=&quot;&quot; new-hires=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; up-and-coming=&quot;&quot; graduate=&quot;&quot; students=&quot;&quot; what=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; they=&quot;&quot; use=&quot;&quot; that=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; different=&quot;&quot; from=&quot;&quot; yours=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 6a&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1a (Berkeley; April 28-30, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1a (Berkeley; April 28-30, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1a&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-D)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Students don't always understand the big investment U's pay for online journal access. To what extent are online journals a scholarly source for research? C1: Authors are cited much more when journals are online. In my field no one uses journals (technology field) because too old by the time it's published. Parallel systems exist. Varies widely by field. (Others agree). Within just astrophysics, there's a lot of granularity w.i. subgroups on how research is done (context of online vs. journals)&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Magic wand: &quot; if=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; had=&quot;&quot; a=&quot;&quot; magic=&quot;&quot; wand=&quot;&quot; what=&quot;&quot; would=&quot;&quot; make=&quot;&quot; your=&quot;&quot; day=&quot;&quot; term=&quot;&quot; research=&quot;&quot; cycle=&quot;&quot; more=&quot;&quot; productive=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; relation=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Magic wand: &quot; if=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; had=&quot;&quot; a=&quot;&quot; magic=&quot;&quot; wand=&quot;&quot; what=&quot;&quot; would=&quot;&quot; make=&quot;&quot; your=&quot;&quot; day=&quot;&quot; term=&quot;&quot; research=&quot;&quot; cycle=&quot;&quot; more=&quot;&quot; productive=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; relation=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 6b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1a (Berkeley; April 28-30, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1a (Berkeley; April 28-30, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1a&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-G)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Finding everything full text on the web, versus going to the library, if it's not online then it's not of interest.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Identify Future Scholarly Practices: &quot; when=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; look=&quot;&quot; at=&quot;&quot; new-hires=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; up-and-coming=&quot;&quot; graduate=&quot;&quot; students=&quot;&quot; what=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; they=&quot;&quot; use=&quot;&quot; that=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; different=&quot;&quot; from=&quot;&quot; yours=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Identify Future Scholarly Practices: &quot; when=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; look=&quot;&quot; at=&quot;&quot; new-hires=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; up-and-coming=&quot;&quot; graduate=&quot;&quot; students=&quot;&quot; what=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; they=&quot;&quot; use=&quot;&quot; that=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; different=&quot;&quot; from=&quot;&quot; yours=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 6a&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-C)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Use of library printed text tends to be in decline. Availability of journals online means that students aren't going to the library.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Brown Univ library is more than warehouse of books/place for study/computer lab/holder of licenses. Libraries at heart of managing and mining information. Need for medicine man not based on clever tech or rich digital content -- based on need for tools that integrate intelligent knowledge acquisition w/ ingenuity of scholars/teachers/learners. Library engaged in developing appropriate architectures/systems/tools to support scholarship. Sustainable methods to respond to today's/tomorrow's information requirements. Brown's Scholarly Tech group and Women Writer's Project integrated into library. Library has opportunity and responsibility to promote new scholarship/new literacites without giving up fundamental reading/writing. Place for production processing &amp; distribution &amp; consumption of knowledge - learn in dialect and language of own choice. Expand ability to question, produce and reproduce knowledge. Library plays a small part in medicine man show-- long live the medicine man, long live Bamboo!&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Welcoming Remarks, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.educause.edu/Community/MemDir/Profiles/HarrietteHemmasi/56254&quot;&gt;Harriette Hemmasi&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
