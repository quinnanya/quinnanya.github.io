<p>"To what extent are new folk replacing library search w. Google search? "Huge". Frightening how exclusively people rely on Google. It's the first place people go (to Google). There's a reliance on electronic sources (Some young people have never seen book journals.) Students don't always understand the big investment U's pay for online journal access. To what extent are online journals a scholarly source for research? Authors are cited much more when journals are online. Not definitive. Need to disaggregate what's ref'ed for research versus teaching. In my field no one uses journals (technology field) because too old by the time it's published."

C1: Authors are cited much more when journals are online. In my field no one uses journals (technology field) because too old by the time it's published. Parallel systems exist. Varies widely by field. (Others agree).

<p>"Brown Univ library is more than warehouse of books/place for study/computer lab/holder of licenses. Libraries at heart of managing and mining information. Need for medicine man not based on clever tech or rich digital content -- based on need for tools that integrate intelligent knowledge acquisition w/ ingenuity of scholars/teachers/learners. Library engaged in developing appropriate architectures/systems/tools to support scholarship. Sustainable methods to respond to today's/tomorrow's information requirements. Brown's Scholarly Tech group and Women Writer's Project integrated into library. Library has opportunity and responsibility to promote new scholarship/new literacites without giving up fundamental reading/writing. Place for production processing & distribution & consumption of knowledge - learn in dialect and language of own choice. Expand ability to question, produce and reproduce knowledge. Library plays a small part in medicine man show-- long live the medicine man, long live Bamboo!"
