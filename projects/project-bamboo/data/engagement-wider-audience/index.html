&lt;p&gt;&quot;With materials online, can no longer anticipate who the users will be in library, esp. rare books.  Can be overwhelming.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;relationships and engagement with the public - this is more fundamental to some fields than others (anthropology, ethnomusicology, etc.)&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Common and Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; common=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; that=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; emerged=&quot;&quot; from=&quot;&quot; your=&quot;&quot; exploration=&quot;&quot; of=&quot;&quot; scholarly=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; based=&quot;&quot; on=&quot;&quot; discussion=&quot;&quot; two=&quot;&quot; piqued=&quot;&quot; the=&quot;&quot; curiosity=&quot;&quot; those=&quot;&quot; at=&quot;&quot; table=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; uncommon=&quot;&quot; makes=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; and=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Common and Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; common=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; that=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; emerged=&quot;&quot; from=&quot;&quot; your=&quot;&quot; exploration=&quot;&quot; of=&quot;&quot; scholarly=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; based=&quot;&quot; on=&quot;&quot; discussion=&quot;&quot; two=&quot;&quot; piqued=&quot;&quot; the=&quot;&quot; curiosity=&quot;&quot; those=&quot;&quot; at=&quot;&quot; table=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; uncommon=&quot;&quot; makes=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; and=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 3&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1d&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-E)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Lets talk about the &quot;publics&quot; we are serving as well. How do we bridge communities effectively? We need to engage those infrastructure, policies, and practices.  This also raises DRM implications.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Common and Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; common=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; that=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; emerged=&quot;&quot; from=&quot;&quot; your=&quot;&quot; exploration=&quot;&quot; of=&quot;&quot; scholarly=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; based=&quot;&quot; on=&quot;&quot; discussion=&quot;&quot; two=&quot;&quot; piqued=&quot;&quot; the=&quot;&quot; curiosity=&quot;&quot; those=&quot;&quot; at=&quot;&quot; table=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; uncommon=&quot;&quot; makes=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; and=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Common and Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; common=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; that=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; emerged=&quot;&quot; from=&quot;&quot; your=&quot;&quot; exploration=&quot;&quot; of=&quot;&quot; scholarly=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; based=&quot;&quot; on=&quot;&quot; discussion=&quot;&quot; two=&quot;&quot; piqued=&quot;&quot; the=&quot;&quot; curiosity=&quot;&quot; those=&quot;&quot; at=&quot;&quot; table=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; uncommon=&quot;&quot; makes=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; and=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 3&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1d&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-E)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Service learning, service trips, internships (putting students into spaces outside the academy). Public being the subject of research ... some conversation here about whether this is a good or a problematic thing ... perhaps better to say that public is the source of information of interest. Explaining to the public why and how work of humanists matters ... to make sure there is public support for funding agencies like the NEH ... but does drive toward relevance dilute the intellectual value of a scholar's work.  Oddity of humanities scholarship is that it operates in a way that values scarcity:  a thing that is little-studied is of more value than something that has been thoroughly chewed over. Q:  is public / community participation a &quot;common&quot; theme in humanities scholarship? There seems to be a general agreement in the public that universities are valuable ... people want their kids to attend. In visual arts, certainly ... anything that requires an audience ... but perhaps not all disciplines are engaged in making public / community participation happen. Any field can benefit by delivering what one knows to a broader (including a public) audience.  Might Bamboo facilitate delivery to that broader audience?  What about delivery platforms for non-traditional artifacts of scholarship?  A filtering mechanism that allows people to find/identify the scholarly artifacts that might interest them.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking a Commonality: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Unpacking a Commonality: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-C)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The boundary of the academy is made permeable by the border-dissolving nature of the internet; and also by prevalence of life-long learning ... the geographical and &quot;must have ID&quot; barriers are dissolved. Establish two way processes that allow engagement with a &quot;public&quot; outside the university (e.g., w/o university-specific &quot;credentials&quot; / authentication/authorization). Intellectual property issues limit openness of engagement / permeability-possibilities ... so approaches to public engagement must enable different degrees and kinds of access to courses, data sets, archival materials, etc. &quot;Discursive forms&quot; ... different types of events that invite engagement might be a way to think about what scholarly activities address or approach public/community participation.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking a Commonality: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Unpacking a Commonality: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-C)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Engage users in folksonomic tagging, giving meaning to a scholarly object, identifying the value or significance of a scholarly object. Engage people in disambiguation or correction of non-automatable data-- might look to a member of the public like &quot;playing a game&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking a Commonality: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Unpacking a Commonality: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-C).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We should do more fieldwork, talk to people more; there is criticism of our approaches. If I were a practitioner, composing, improvising, I would be part of a broader field of cultural production.  Would have an idea of what might be missing within the subgenre (say, rock and roll). Challenge people's ideas about what a good R&amp;R song is or what a good melody.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking a Commonality: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Unpacking a Commonality: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1c&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-A)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Was talking to someone about something, the interviewee said &quot;well it's not exactly like that&quot; &quot;But that's what you've been telling me for years&quot; &quot;Because that's how you've been asking the question.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking a Commonality: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Unpacking a Commonality: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1c&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-A)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;My inclination is to come back to:  how do you choose an audience? Can we find something to help us choose an audience? Can we get an audience to come to us? What is significance of audience we are trying to catch? Intentional abstraction. When it gets repurposed, a lot can be repurposed, when they move outside of that what happens?   We have the tools now to do annotation after the data is out there so people can choose the data. Don't know what that requires of the data. Machines are literal-minded, but now you can search for shapes on Blobworld. &quot;Dogs must be carried on the escalator&quot; can mean two things. Point at which it's describable we know what to do. These clumps of material come before the audience. The audience is that researcher trying to come up w/ the concepts. At certain point it may be ready for exposure. Getting a handle on what those tools look like.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking a Commonality: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Unpacking a Commonality: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1d&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-G)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Creating analogies is a first step. Describe unfamiliar in terms of the familiar. Must know field you're speaking to. Process of writing in unconscious, but you are imagining who the audience is. Framing it for that. Digital does a bad job of doing that; think of themselves as the audience. At some stage you are the audience; has to be an oscillation between the states of self referential and public state. A dialogic model. Look at a painting - look at the strokes then move back to look at the whole. Shifts in balance toward other people. To what extent do we choose an audience? Done workshops for graduate students and faculty on how to get published. But History projects - catalogues of baseball cards, blueprints, and posters. Doesn't really serve scholars' aims all that well.  Sifting has to be with users and use behind it. Good at some cataloging and not others.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking a Commonality: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Unpacking a Commonality: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1d&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-G)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;had one of those moments: he was working with urban Appalachians, had been documenting one guy's house, didn't have a wide-angle lens, tried to capture interiors... urban Appalachians live in bourgeois houses but in a nonbourgeois way. this guy offered to take pictures of his house for the scholar.  the scholar wrote a piece about the structures of this guy's videotape and of the house, which informed each other. the idea of the subject of study speaking back goes back to a broader idea where the study itself is reflexive, there is a general ethos about the significance of being reflexive in your methodology&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking the Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Unpacking the Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-B)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;one of his colleagues decided in the context of a field investigation (which is normally v. hierarchical both in organization and in interpretation) to implement a multivocal experience where they took video and interviewed the low-ranking students, the workmen, etc., to get multiple voices about what people thought they were digging for. he attempted to publish something about it in print form. and he wants to make this stuff available universally&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking the Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Unpacking the Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-B)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Fieldwork needs to be returned to the source communities. Requires an archive, could lead to unexpected use later. Public and academic constituencies. Can be produced in different formats. People who engage in fieldwork are both creators and critics. The concept of a &quot;public humanist&quot; is not very well developed, even though there are public humanities councils in each state. Digital media allows one to perhaps reach broader constituencies. I work as much or more in public situations than in academic situations. With community organizations, labor unions etc. Native American Indian tribes to help them develop educational systems, etc. So what's your pain? People die. Well known people in their communities. The other pain is that although 75% of the world's people are ignored, the people studying them are also ignored in universities. One falls between the cracks of disciplines in universities. Do you get restrictions imposed on you in your fieldwork? Yes, all the time. But that's ok. We don't have to tell, or know everything. Do you get institutional releases for your fieldwork? I try to avoid my institutional IRB because I don't like the way they work. I have release forms but I use them in the way that makes best sense to my community and my work. If we want to share data, we need to respect one another's ethical codes for sharing information, artifacts etc.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking the Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Unpacking the Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-E)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;talking about giving something back. This kind of return isn't characteristic of much of humanities. The desire to return to the studied community. Reciprocity. Principle of fairness: someone shares something of themselves with you, you owe something back. If one is dealing with people rather than objects, there's a set of obligations different from when dealing with artifacts.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking the Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Unpacking the Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1c&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-A)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
