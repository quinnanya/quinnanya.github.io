Not necessarily embedded in universities, but alongside.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We get closer to N America form [of humanities centers] if we think about interdisciplinarity- this has been shibboleth under which these centers have been developed. Counting how often provosts/presidents use the word interdisciplinary - astonishing how many times they can use it in 3 minute greeting. This gets closer, but not the key issue for humanities centers. A way of thinking about disciplinarity posits disciplines as static and stable and imagines all interesting work appears between them - doesn't do justice to either end.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups. A straw consortial model for Project Bamboo was also introduced and discussed.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hum center form can be understood as more generic center of a whole series of other kinds of centers that hve been developed in last 40 years around &quot;studies&quot; (gender, race, science, etc). Clearinghouse for all those specific &quot;studies&quot; - shadow disciplines trying to emerge. &quot;Emergingly disciplinary&quot;. That evolution, can be helpful to think of CenterNet project - evolution from parts of universities that are IT places that have increasingly addressed disciplinary fields. Humanities center form evolving toward a notion of institutional change - taking more responsibility for, not to defer change by virtue of their existence, but new ways of putting university together. Movement on d hum side represented by digital humanities center -supplying most important/powerful engines of change. Not engine of change that led to Hum institute for in 50's/60's (new theoretical formations, new topics).&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups. A straw consortial model for Project Bamboo was also introduced and discussed.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Emergence of DHum as coherent field - accompanied by/result of Hum Computing center as institution as found in Princeton/Rutgers center for electronic texts, UVA Institute of Advanced Tech in Humanities, Brown's scholarly tech group.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;John Unsworth cited strengths of DHum centers bringing to field - mentoring for H scholars doing digital research, staffing and long-term security for projects, opportunities for H faculty/grad students working as collective intellectual enterprise. D Hum centers could play fundamental role in transforming humanities if they worked together. Most important outcome: founding of CenterNet - over 200 members. Born from conviction that centers could do more together than separately.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups. A straw consortial model for Project Bamboo was also introduced and discussed.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;&quot;a survey of Digital Hum centers in the US&quot; - sobering assessment of current landscape. 1. silo-like nature of centers is creating untethered digital production, projects with little support outside center, more likely to be orphaned. 2. doesn't leverage resources community-wide. 3. large-scale coordinated efforts to build cyberinfrastructure are missing.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups. A straw consortial model for Project Bamboo was also introduced and discussed.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Can see from problems how Bamboo's silo-busting, big-picture approach might appeal to CenterNet and constituent centers. DHum centers are quintessential Hum labs for kind of exploration/demonstration, sandbox, support in which PB is deeply invested.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are all concerned /w disciplinary innovation and transformation. Task before us all - produce &quot;change we can believe in&quot;. Discussions &gt; concrete ways we could together effect meaningful change.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;New cluster of research projects began emerging - H research center realized that it didn't have infrastructure/wherewithal to support cutting-edge projects that were emerging. Set up consortium for research and information outreach - beginning of evolution of d hum from humanities.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Consortium for research/info outreach had 5 main goals: develop/publish research in digital video/database formats. Development of infrastructure. Serviced all hum scholars across the university, not just those in hum research center. Collaborate w/ multimedia researchers, integrate digital media. Extend opportunities for postgrad training - new development in last 5 years. Short-term professional courses for staff in Australian institutions who want expertise.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Connecting research results- bringing info from different research projects together (prototype multi-institutional search engine). Preserving research data - archive and accessing in various projects (indigenous land-management practices, etc.) We have worked w/ other institutions, we can't do this with just one institution - critical collaborators.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups. A straw consortial model for Project Bamboo was also introduced and discussed.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;In the last 3 years, also realized that like a lot of us in Humanities, about critical input of digital media into humanities - can't just stay as niche research platform. Began to pervade a lot of research being done across the board in the centers. Since 2006, has been development - evolution of humanities research. Had a lot of discussion to create what we call a digital humanities hub. Just got some funding in the middle of last year. Contains all constituents who supported initial stage of formation of digital humanities hub - range of activities is a lot wider, caters to a wider constituency.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups. A straw consortial model for Project Bamboo was also introduced and discussed.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Australian gov has set up national collaborative research structure strategy, but until 2007 it catered only to science sector. Millions of dollars of funding, but didn't think Hum needed research infrastructure in this area. Only early last year they said they'd include Hum and SS in assessment of the sector's capability. Giving them 50 mil dollars if they can justify that they need those resources. Our center has been critically involved - &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Chad J. Kainz, Senior Director for Academic Technologies in Networking Services &amp; Information Technologies at the University of Chicago (later, Asst. Chief IT Officer and Executive Director, Campus &amp; Academic Services in IT Services) was a Co-Director and subsequently Principal Investigator for the Bamboo Planning Project.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Chad J.

Work closely with Australia's academy of humanities, other lobbying groups. Part of a lot of e-research commissioned by federal gov.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups. A straw consortial model for Project Bamboo was also introduced and discussed.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;In listening to [scholars], attempting to respond, might be worthwhile to put pressure here on the notion of research and project. Research: would prefer to re-describe or re-name what we are attempting to designate &quot;research&quot; either as scholarly practices or simply in terms of work activity. In content of Hum centers, this does tend to be interdisciplinary, breadth that reaches from arts through trad hum disciplines, to social sciences, but isn't particularly adherent to (has mandate not to) work with specific disciplinary divisions, but work across and between them 9and across media).&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups. A straw consortial model for Project Bamboo was also introduced and discussed.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Would be missing something important if we went forward thinking about DHum in any context w/o taking account of amount of work/activity that goes in form of &quot;exchange of ideas&quot;. Centers typically the hubs of exchanging ideas across disciplines/in relation to various media. How can DHum help support and enhance kinds of idea exchange contexts and situations that tend to take place at centers?&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups. A straw consortial model for Project Bamboo was also introduced and discussed.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Not pursuing a &quot;ghetto&quot; for dig humanities, but blend seamlessly in activities of the center. Enhancing and supporting the activities we carry on regularly. Recognize that there's out there in the world some skepticism and resistance to some of these new directions. Were told at one meeting &quot;why are you doing this, we want to spend less time in front of our computers&quot;. Clearly Hum centers can take a lead (some of these activities can be blended as seamlessly as possible into ongoing scholarly practices - a greater chance of success). Both in what we've received/learned and what we're putting out - one needs to be careful in managing expectations (hopes, promises).&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;In this version of D Hum (supports/enhances scholarly dialog) -  one in which we can imagine someday saying &quot;wow, everything seems kind of the same but it's all new&quot;. That sort of transformation where the world is the same but wholly new that I imagine us pursuing for Hum center.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.
