<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;often universities have staff but not money; e.g. Habitat for Humanity: sweat equity; maybe small institutions who can't afford $ could contribute sweat equity&quot; (&lt;span accomplish=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; do=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr accomplish=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 1&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-B)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Small, liberal arts colleges really are underfunded. Many colleagues in the same boat. Working on Ernst Barlach.. copyright issues are a real pain.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Grad student practices - we have 3 areas of expertise: visual culture, museum culture, and mapping. Produce creative theses, have to do a dissertation, but also produce a film (visual anthropologists) but we came up to limits of our digital facilities. Electric installation art - have to write about it but also produce one himself. Problems: creating his piece of art, depends on audience interaction. Found it difficult to accommodate every dimension of that w/ in a video context. Sought all kinds of expertise but existing resources didn't enable him to produce a thesis w/ all elements. Talked to supercomputing who helped him come up w/ modeling to simulate entire process. A lot of PhD scholarship is collaborative in our institution.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;how many have read acls report for cyberinfrastructure? found striking: isn't this what libraries (e.g. at harvard) already do? maybe we should link all these libraries together, given that we rent access to datasets. good for institutions with lots of funds. maybe bamboo could analyze carefully what infrastructure would work for the poor as well as the rich. one way we move from paper to digital (maps, e.g.) is by scanning, but at $20-30/sheet, hundreds of sheets, adds up. need to know who else has already done this. think of slide libraries already moving to scanned images, separately, when costs of moving slides into database with metadata is quite high.&quot; (&lt;span a=&quot;&quot; activities=&quot;&quot; and=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; best=&quot;&quot; by=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; consortial=&quot;&quot; discuss=&quot;&quot; effort=&quot;&quot; explain=&quot;&quot; future=&quot;&quot; like=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; supported=&quot;&quot; think=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Opportunities for Bamboo: &quot; which=&quot;&quot; why.=&quot;&quot; would=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr a=&quot;&quot; activities=&quot;&quot; and=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; best=&quot;&quot; by=&quot;&quot; consortial=&quot;&quot; discuss=&quot;&quot; effort=&quot;&quot; explain=&quot;&quot; future=&quot;&quot; like=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; supported=&quot;&quot; think=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Opportunities for Bamboo: &quot; which=&quot;&quot; why.=&quot;&quot; would=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 7&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1d&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-E)&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;How can PB add value at my institution? Group of small liberal arts institutions. We all had a neg impression for what possibilities would be for small lib arts inst. Does it make sense for us to continue to be involved? Want to stay positive- we can build something together that will be great. What can PB do that's creative, innovative, and will last that will entice people to use PB services. 3 small thoughts on what that could be:&lt;br /&gt;</p>
<ol>
<li>Bamboo Facebook - could PB make some sort of service that acts as scholarly orientation/organization for dig hum? Twitter people, poke your faculty friends, do digital scholarship, all Web 2.0 - don't have to have hard buildings for hum scholarship, could do it virtually. My faculty might be interested - we're in a small area in Virginia.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
<li>Bamboo Marketplace - I have faculty asking &quot;I just have a little small project, some Java code, something that will do this) - we don't have a Java programmer for your specific project, but what if there was a marketplace and look for people who might be selling their wares there. Java programmers with some background in the Humanities - like bringing something home from the marketplace and taking it home. Helps me - solved problem for faculty member. 3. Finally - float up a Bamboo cloud. Help me get out of storage business, high-performance computing. We're a small place - do I have to hire computationalists to run a comp cluster for 3 faculty members who run the same 5 codes as everyone else everywhere?&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;One point I would underscore is the importance of Project Bamboo assisting smaller institutions. I represent one such institution, where our funding and resources are not abundant. However, we have collections that I am sure would be of interest to large and small institutions throughout not just our region, but outside our region as well. It would be great if Project Bamboo could serve, at least in part, as a consortium to aid and assist small institutions needing guidance, tools, and expertise from those more knowledgeable in digital humanities.&quot; (Tools &amp; Content Partners working group, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linkedin.com/pub/rich-wisneski/7/479/a47&quot;&gt;Richard Wisneski&lt;/a&gt;, 1/14/09 comment)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
