<p>"Wrong to see these things as built into a massive architecture that would then be used across the board. Ultimately looking at obsolence too quickly. Provide a resource center? Or a repository? For tools, software, etc. to be used. Funding opportunities for infrastructure to developing these tools. Every collection of tools will be outdated immediately. Full involvement of community to delay obsolence, and to avoid unnecessary expenditure of energy for something that might ultimately not be useful. More likelihood for people to be willing to invest in software that they've already used, and that they're familiar with. Obviously, open-source makes this more feasible."

<p>"How can Bamboo help scholars and librarians do a better job managing the challenges of digital textuality? If Bamboo plays the proverbial role of the onion in the stew or the role of a skilful host who introduces guests and then gets out the way of their conversation, much good can come of it. If it develops a large agenda of its own and is very visibly there, it may spend a lot of money but do little good."
