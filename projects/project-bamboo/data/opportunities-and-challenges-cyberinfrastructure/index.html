        <p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Difficult to decide on an abstract architecture when bottom-up tool development is moving (percolating) so quickly. What can facilitate quick and agile adoption of quickly developing tools.&quot; (&lt;span accomplish=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; do=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr accomplish=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 1&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1c&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-C)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;One of possibilities w/ Bamboo is becoming big enough to create generalizable tools that community knows about.&quot; (&lt;span accomplish=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; do=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr accomplish=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 1&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1d&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-B)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;&quot;middleware&quot;; create a tool which brings existing tools to everyone on their own taxonomic terms. how do we apply that to &quot;i'm a researcher; help!&quot;&quot; (&lt;span accomplish=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; do=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr accomplish=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 1&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1d&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-C)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;tension between infrastructure and innovation; for 90% of digital humanities work can be put under basic categories and structures to remove duplication; need to allow duplication, Bamboo needs a competitor or else Bamboo will take over the garden and use up all the oxygen&quot; (&lt;span accomplish=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; do=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr accomplish=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 1&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1d&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-F)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;One concern of this group was the danger that Bamboo become just another platform for tools and not an organic, dynamic and creative space that allows humanities scholars to share a vision and engage in new practices.&quot; (&lt;span a=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; day=&quot;&quot; during=&quot;&quot; good=&quot;&quot; really=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Exploring Scholarly Practice: &quot;&gt;&lt;abbr a=&quot;&quot; day=&quot;&quot; during=&quot;&quot; good=&quot;&quot; really=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Exploring Scholarly Practice: &quot;&gt;Ex 2&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-D)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Infrastructure for tracking and cutting across many tools. Danger that [a background tracking mechanism] will turn humanities academics against the project because of the idea that they'll be monitored. Any given humanities scholar would hopefully come down on both sides of the question. Good [for a scholar] to know [her/his] impact, while at the same time not wanting to feel &quot;watched&quot; or &quot;tracked&quot;&quot; (&lt;span are=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; common=&quot;&quot; emerged=&quot;&quot; exploration=&quot;&quot; from=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; of=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; scholarly=&quot;&quot; that=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Common and Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; your=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr are=&quot;&quot; common=&quot;&quot; emerged=&quot;&quot; exploration=&quot;&quot; from=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; of=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; scholarly=&quot;&quot; that=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Common and Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; your=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 3&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1c&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-B)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;While Bb is doing this it should however do become too rigid a structure. There should be a structural flexibility that would allow it to keep growing and changing and also allow it to include different models of scholarship, fringe scholars, etc. features like a sand box area for pure play.&quot; (&lt;span are=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking a Commonality: &quot; what=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr are=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking a Commonality: &quot; what=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-D)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Over- and under-promising in technology. A realistic expectation of Bamboo is to recognize that it's limited. Infrastructure systems do well when recognizing their best minimum cases, and providing means for experts to come in and adapt/adjust.&quot; (&lt;span are=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking the Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr are=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking the Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1c&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-A)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Wrong to see these things as built into a massive architecture that would then be used across the board. Ultimately looking at obsolence too quickly. Provide a resource center? Or a repository? For tools, software, etc. to be used. Funding opportunities for infrastructure to developing these tools. Every collection of tools will be outdated immediately. Full involvement of community to delay obsolence, and to avoid unnecessary expenditure of energy for something that might ultimately not be useful. More likelihood for people to be willing to invest in software that they've already used, and that they're familiar with. Obviously, open-source makes this more feasible.&quot; (&lt;span are=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking the Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr are=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking the Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1c&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-B)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Fear that what we develop will be outdated by the time we're done; maybe by then everyone will be in Second Life; How to create tools that take advantage of changing environment that we can plug into?&quot; (&lt;span accomplish=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; do=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr accomplish=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 1&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1c&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-E)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;We need to reduce barriers to entry with experiments and new ideas integrating tech, like repositories, etc. Sees need for utility services that can foster this. Concerned that humanities scholars will have no clue where to start with utilities services. They do not know what to do with these and how to write glue code. Sees a need for helping them to get started.&quot; (&lt;span a=&quot;&quot; activities=&quot;&quot; and=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; best=&quot;&quot; by=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; consortial=&quot;&quot; discuss=&quot;&quot; effort=&quot;&quot; explain=&quot;&quot; future=&quot;&quot; like=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; supported=&quot;&quot; think=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Opportunities for Bamboo: &quot; which=&quot;&quot; why.=&quot;&quot; would=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr a=&quot;&quot; activities=&quot;&quot; and=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; best=&quot;&quot; by=&quot;&quot; consortial=&quot;&quot; discuss=&quot;&quot; effort=&quot;&quot; explain=&quot;&quot; future=&quot;&quot; like=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; supported=&quot;&quot; think=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Opportunities for Bamboo: &quot; which=&quot;&quot; why.=&quot;&quot; would=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 7&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1a (Berkeley; April 28-30, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1a (Berkeley; April 28-30, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1a&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-H)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;The &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The Atlas was a somewhat amorphous piece of the Bamboo Implementation Plan. The long-term vision Bamboo Program Document stated that the Atlas would record and deliver community input (Scholarly Narratives, Tool examples, Content/Resource examples, Service Families, community-contributed references to information outside the formal bounds of Bamboo, etc.) in easily updated, linked, annotatable forms that may be mixed, matched, categorized, and re-categorized.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;The Atlas was a somewhat amorphous piece of the Bamboo Implementation Plan.

Faculty are trained to consult experts in other domains, not only in technology, but other areas of scholarship.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;How can Bamboo help scholars and librarians do a better job managing the challenges of digital textuality? If Bamboo plays the proverbial role of the onion in the stew or the role of a skilful host who introduces guests and then gets out the way of their conversation, much good can come of it. If it develops a large agenda of its own and is very visibly there, it may spend a lot of money but do little good.&quot; (Tools &amp; Content Partners working group, Analyzing Scholarly Narratives, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.english.northwestern.edu/people/mueller.html&quot;&gt;Martin Mueller&lt;/a&gt;, 3/27/09)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;But we're in a state of transition, and needs/currencies are also transitory. Catalyst for changes is technology. Advances in tech (done to us, ones we've done). Have altered fundamentals of teaching/learning/research. How scholarship is generated/assimilated/preserved/interpreted/reused/etc are critical to academy/academic library. Blurred lines of responsibility; emergence of global info society relying on knowledge economy and sustainable infrastructure. Doesn't threaten assistance of libraries, but positioned libraries as key partners in addressing issues facing changing economies/modes of communication.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Welcoming Remarks, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.educause.edu/Community/MemDir/Profiles/HarrietteHemmasi/56254&quot;&gt;Harriette Hemmasi&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;In 1985, as professor at Harvard, came down here to work on project on huge workstation. Brown has a long tradition of doing this since the 70's. This could've been someone else showing it with &quot;advanced&quot; systems 25 years ago. Still having the same conversation - this could've happened in 1985 (and did happen then). Linking contents. Opportunity of PB is to get us out of that lull so we're not treading water, and having the same kind of conversation. Getting the infrastructure that we need; accumulation of parts. Hopefully in 20 years, this won't have to be reinvented again and again.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Welcome, Q&amp;A)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;The proposal is about cyberinfrastructure where there's different points to span the bridge for different universities. PB doesn't work unless we can tie it back to the specific, for the difference PB can make. Trying to derive social relations between people in same/different field. Adding together some of the particulars. Focus on particular tools in particular disciplines, where people are ready to move ahead with the evolution there, too. Where are the opportunities? Way to move forward is to focus on representative projects in years 1-3? Hope that people across the world can take advantage of different content/tools.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Overview of &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The Bamboo Program Document (drafts published March-April 2009) was a an outline for a possible 7-10 year vision for the Bamboo Community, discussed at Workshop 4.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;The Bamboo Program Document (drafts published March-April 2009) was a an outline for a possible 7-10 year vision for the Bamboo Community, discussed at Workshop 4.&quot;&gt;Program Document&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;David Greenbaum, Director of Data Services at the University of California, Berkeley, was a Co-Director of the Bamboo Planning Project.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;David Greenbaum, Director of Data Services at the University of California, Berkeley, was a Co-Director of the Bamboo Planning Project.&quot;&gt;David Greenbaum&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Duraspace - Fedora and DSpace - building institutional repositories. Model where by banding together, they can use cloud-based storage services. Problem for how to support from digital library side. People are struggling forward, trying to figure out how to band together.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 4 (April 16 - 18, 2009) included conversations about the discussion draft of the Bamboo Program Document, straw polls about interest in the program draft's areas of focus, and action plans by the groups that formed out of the straw polls.&quot;&gt;W4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Action Plan - 4.1 Services &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The Atlas was a somewhat amorphous piece of the Bamboo Implementation Plan.
