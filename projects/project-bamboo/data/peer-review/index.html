<p>"We need a peer review for the stuff that matters to us now. Way of referencing a vetting process. Attempts to do that:  Merlot w/ pedagogical tools. More than a social network. Work and digital scholarship for peer review. Rather than a parallel peer review system, what we should do is look for senior established colleagues who can take risks and who would do something different - persuade them to publish something in a digital form. By taking that step it makes it more respectable for junior people to do. Peer review in place for this digital journal. There are forms of scholarly work that don't fit - might be service, scholarship at same time. Need other way of having this work outside of our own institutions. Resistance not just review; metrics not there to evaluate online edition.  Faculty numbers are not growing but nontenured track is growing significantly. Depts need research professionals - nonclass of academic staff. Shouldn't create a separate academic class but how to measure the merit."

<p>"Be more pragmatic; it's hard to evaluate digital scholarship. PB could provide set of criteria, peer review techniques for evaluating it.

<p>"Need to be cognizant that there's standards for evaluation already; MLA already developed standards. PB should consider who are the faculty who are coming in to work on these things.

<p>"the documents for P & T put together by the MLA for digital work are too general to serve as policy manuals at any given institution: they sometimes state the obvious, e.g., that a peer-reviewed journal online should count as much as a peer-reviewed article appearing in print, valued according to the online venue's stated number of submissions and percentage of rejections.  But still, she makes clear that unfortunately the obvious still needs to be said. She also notes that one of the highlights of the MLA workshop was when she realized that department chairs need to offer external and internal reviewers detailed instructions on how to evaluate what they see. At Research 1 universities, it isn't uncommon for tenure cases to be turned down at the higher levels even when these same tenure cases have been wholeheartedly supported by specific departments; and so candidates, external reviewers, and chairs face the added burden of having to educate deans and provosts through documentation and explanation. At the moment, for better or for worse, the onus is mostly on the candidates to explain what institutional bodies have ratified your work, and exactly what form has that ratification taken. Perhaps one form of that ratification could be an online written evaluation composed by scholars constituting particular editorial boards, perhaps housed at Bamboo." (Education working group, <a href="http://www.loriemerson.com/">Lori Emerson</a>, 1/12/2009 post)</p>
<p>"Regardless, overall, most of the participants that I corresponded with agreed that one of the main problems to evaluating digital work is that the artificiality of the dossier form required by most institutions lacks flexibility for explaining the relevance of a digital project. My colleagues also noted that there is currently an uncomfortable channeling of so-called Digital Humanities work into established tracks whose establishment may itself be a subject of reconsideration (for example, the continued relevance of the term "humanities" is up for debate for many people currently in so-called humanities departments). The general consensus is also that organizations such as the MLA or such as Bamboo might want to find ways to bring the review process into the open and use the affordances of networking technologies to create a profession-wide, peer to peer, network for active and public evaluation." (Education working group, <a href="http://www.loriemerson.com/">Lori Emerson</a>, 1/12/2009 post)</p>
<p>"MLA documents on tenure/promotion state the obvious, but that's needed. Could PB have a role in ratification of digital work. Dossier form is not amenable to digital work ... lacks way to express relevance of a digital project. Profession-wide active/public evaluation - can PB enable that?"
