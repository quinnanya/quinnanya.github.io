<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Interdisciplinary scholarshipimportant for people to be able to discover each other. How can we create tools to help people to do this? Social networking, etc.&quot; (Day 2, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1a (Berkeley; April 28-30, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1a (Berkeley; April 28-30, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1a&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Discover social networks; Can't be black box - needs visibility to get trust in arts and humanities. True across the board&quot; (&lt;span a=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; day=&quot;&quot; during=&quot;&quot; good=&quot;&quot; really=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Exploring Scholarly Practice: &quot;&gt;&lt;abbr a=&quot;&quot; day=&quot;&quot; during=&quot;&quot; good=&quot;&quot; really=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Exploring Scholarly Practice: &quot;&gt;Ex 2&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1a (Berkeley; April 28-30, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1a (Berkeley; April 28-30, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1a&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-A)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Would a social networking project be more of a time suck than anything else? (think of the time we already see our students spending on facebook).&quot; (&lt;span a=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; day=&quot;&quot; during=&quot;&quot; good=&quot;&quot; really=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Exploring Scholarly Practice: &quot;&gt;&lt;abbr a=&quot;&quot; day=&quot;&quot; during=&quot;&quot; good=&quot;&quot; really=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Exploring Scholarly Practice: &quot;&gt;Ex 2&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1a (Berkeley; April 28-30, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1a (Berkeley; April 28-30, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1a&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-C)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;We should consider building social networking tools that enable people to articulate needs among others with an interest to be able to point or volunteer to build/create.&quot; (&lt;span are=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; common=&quot;&quot; emerged=&quot;&quot; exploration=&quot;&quot; from=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; of=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; scholarly=&quot;&quot; that=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Common and Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; your=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr are=&quot;&quot; common=&quot;&quot; emerged=&quot;&quot; exploration=&quot;&quot; from=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; of=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; scholarly=&quot;&quot; that=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Common and Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; your=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 3&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1d&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-E)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Production (AV) networks (temporary organizations), contrast with academic network, where everyone's working for themselves. There's less of a path up, less of an incentive for people to network. Another traditional network are around humanities center. Also people who studied at a particular program. In mailing lists you can lurk, and still get something from that experience. Very different from older means of introduction into and engagement in a mailing list. You need to be able to demonstrate competency in some collections. New technologies allow you to participate in these communities without the traditional entree.&quot; (&lt;span are=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking the Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr are=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking the Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-E)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;New hires want to communicate w. students via blogging, IM. Faculty is posting everything teaching related. Closely related to research, as in sharing research via content mgmt system, but then also use it to share work. There's a blurred, fluid movement between social and other networking for interactions. Tremendous use of FaceBook, MySpace for things, including research. Their interests are interwoven: can't easily separate personal &amp; research interests.&quot; (&lt;span at=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; graduate=&quot;&quot; look=&quot;&quot; new-hires=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; students=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Identify Future Scholarly Practices: &quot; up-and-coming=&quot;&quot; when=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr at=&quot;&quot; graduate=&quot;&quot; look=&quot;&quot; new-hires=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; students=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Identify Future Scholarly Practices: &quot; up-and-coming=&quot;&quot; when=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 6a&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1a (Berkeley; April 28-30, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1a (Berkeley; April 28-30, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1a&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-D)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Blurring work/research/social domains. Combing formal &amp; informal interactions&quot; (&lt;span at=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; graduate=&quot;&quot; look=&quot;&quot; new-hires=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; students=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Identify Future Scholarly Practices: &quot; up-and-coming=&quot;&quot; when=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr at=&quot;&quot; graduate=&quot;&quot; look=&quot;&quot; new-hires=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; students=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Identify Future Scholarly Practices: &quot; up-and-coming=&quot;&quot; when=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 6a&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1a (Berkeley; April 28-30, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1a (Berkeley; April 28-30, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1a&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-F)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;social component is huge. social networking &amp; social connections play a larger role. facebook popular with save minority languages movements, find events. merger of graduate work and social movements --&gt; departments find themselves admiring and responding to these changes. not a wide-eyed trend, more of a cynical/suspicious. ability to communicate with one another. does take people away from the library.... some amount of solo work is required -- books to read, films to watch closely. tendency to work on multiple facets independently. humanists somewhat dispirited if they're working in areas that don't have this open, sociable, interaction&quot; (&lt;span at=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; graduate=&quot;&quot; look=&quot;&quot; new-hires=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; students=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Identify Future Scholarly Practices: &quot; up-and-coming=&quot;&quot; when=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr at=&quot;&quot; graduate=&quot;&quot; look=&quot;&quot; new-hires=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; students=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Identify Future Scholarly Practices: &quot; up-and-coming=&quot;&quot; when=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 6a&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-A)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;High print based, self-selected group of students. Behaviors at my inst. are extensions of traditional methods. e.g. Google books, Zotero. Social networking. More of a blending of their social and their academic networking. Facebook used for both. Blogging random thoughts and academic interests. Which leads to an interesting re-configuration what a colleague is..&quot; (&lt;span at=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; graduate=&quot;&quot; look=&quot;&quot; new-hires=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; students=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Identify Future Scholarly Practices: &quot; up-and-coming=&quot;&quot; when=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr at=&quot;&quot; graduate=&quot;&quot; look=&quot;&quot; new-hires=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; students=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Identify Future Scholarly Practices: &quot; up-and-coming=&quot;&quot; when=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 6a&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-C)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Extent to which relationships spend time face to face, meet in person is dwindling. Grad students networked across institutions. Social networking not intellectual networking &gt; Only in finding like-minded people, building networks, arguing about ideas not tightly coupled to what you see as your original contribution&quot; (&lt;span at=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; graduate=&quot;&quot; look=&quot;&quot; new-hires=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; students=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Identify Future Scholarly Practices: &quot; up-and-coming=&quot;&quot; when=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr at=&quot;&quot; graduate=&quot;&quot; look=&quot;&quot; new-hires=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; students=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Identify Future Scholarly Practices: &quot; up-and-coming=&quot;&quot; when=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 6a&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1c&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-C)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Persistent network of social connections that travel with them. Pervasive connectedness and operation within an information environment that cuts across personal, professional, published, and unpublished. It is porous.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Grad students are running their own conferences with topics often more interesting than those at scholarly associations.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;A way to help digital humanists find each other - how many people say to themselves &quot;I'm a digital humanist&quot;.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Question posed about that we know a bit more about research practices, not so much about communication/collaboration, drivers and practices among humanists. Do we have enough information to go in the right direction? How do we get it? Communication practices - discussion happened in W1 and research has been done about research needs, but when talking about scholarly network this is how they collaborate.&quot; (Scholarly Networking working group, 12/9 meeting notes)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;WHAT: As Senior Academic Technology Officer for the CUNY Graduate Center, I participate actively in a CUNY-wide (20 senior and community colleges, spread across the five boroughs of New York City) Academic Technology (A.T.) committee, which is comprised of CUNY faculty from each of our campuses who are actively engaged in using A.T. for teaching and research. We are in the process of setting up an Academic Commons (AC) website which will allow faculty to engage one another using a range of Web 2.0 resources (e.g., blogs and wikis, CMS, etc.) and to push forward a collective conversation about how best to deploy A.T. across CUNY's myriad teaching and research environments.&lt;br /&gt;
HOW: We are focused on being able to offer three interrelated &quot;basic functional pieces&quot;: information (the AC should make it easy to publish useful information); identity (the AC should be able to easily display customizable profiles and should allow users to build communities through them via social networking tools); and interaction (tagging, collective editing, commenting).&lt;br /&gt;
HELPS: We currently use a Moodle site to stay in touch individually and through our sub-committees, but I'm not certain that this is the best environment for the long term.&lt;br /&gt;
NEEDS: Our challenge is to identify the best platform(s) to use to accomplish this set of tasks. What are the best/most optimal hardware and software configurations to use, given learning curves and costs, both human and financial? Open source vs. proprietary; Moodle vs. Drupal vs. WordPress Multi-User vs. Plone; PHP vs. Python; Oracle vs. Flash vs. Microsoft?

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;NEED: The Walt Whitman Walking Tour and Online Critical Edition needs support with setup and implementation of a feedback device for users to be able to comment on their experiences during and after they have taken the walking tour. Although my knowledge of web design is strong, it has not proved sufficient to do the backend database setup that is required to design and implement such a system.
