<p>"Ways in which these efforts can help us/other make public what they're doing in dig technologies in relation to humanities. We're not the only ones who're pursued a piece of a project only to find after months that someone down the hall has already done it. Or that there's a far more widespread use of dig tech by humanists colleagues. Or that grad students in Hum had unbelievable degree of tech expertise."

<p>"Title "Bamboo and Content Stewards" changed to "Clumps and Runners". "Torturing the Bamboo metaphor". Exchange of ideas - lots of work in the humanities carried on this way. There are no ideas but in things. Things in the humanities - wide variety of material and cultural heritage. Tracing DNA in parchment to trace movement across medieval systems of commerce. Lots of interest in things in the humanities." (<span class="glossary-term" title="Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.
