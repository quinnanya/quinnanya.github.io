<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hard to find toolsother people's custom tools are based on different assumptions&quot; (&lt;span accomplish=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; do=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr accomplish=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 1&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1c&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-E)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's not about &quot;preservation&quot; it's &quot;durability&quot; (as a way to get away from the freeze-dry parts of the metaphor).

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Would like to see a growing awareness of what the tools discovery process is so entrenched. But what if we find them? Old interfaces, defunct languages, different purposes.. still effectively unusable. So then what are the obstacles to re-use?

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;We've done a lot of data mining with numbers, they're trying to do the same principles applied to texts, and you come up with different problems. This informs our approach, it distinguishes humanities from the sciences. We've solved the problems of how to encode numbers a long time ago, but encoding humanities material is an ongoing issue. Still no standard format for film. New versions of MPEG every year, no standard for music encoding. Difficult to build tools. A question of representation of humanities objects. Problem with text is you have to deal with synonyms/homonyms/alternative spelling. Fields like astronomy have agreed on a standard way to do things; progress will be made when fields decide &quot;this is how we're going to do X&quot;. Semantics are understood when scientists use numbers: a count of something, a spectrum, etc. Nothing is inherent about the semantics of Humanities texts. When you're talking about texts, text is in a historical context - a particular point in time. Important to see it in a continuum of time and evolution. Has to be room for multiple interpretations.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Can tools built to common standards coffer a compromise between commercial and open-source? Always an investment - no way to de-couple tools from standards in an effective way. True, sometimes the interface of certain tools require training that are beyond the scope of a projects. Return to a J-Stor for tools. A company like Oxygen has a better record for producing tools that are useful and sustainable, as opposed to Digital Humanitites Project. Should be careful not to be tied into particular commercial software. We haven't got a good track record for building useful open-source tools. But people have been building tools for themselves. We have to explore possibility of approaching open-source developers to make these tools more widely available and easier to use.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;suggest a deliverable for bamboo... If people are providing web services according to standards, distinguish between reliable services that you can build on vs other of short term projects or things under development.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;I should add that in the Monk project we have solved the problem of transforming TCP texts (and similar texts) into a linguistic corpus where a single morphosyntactic tagging and lemmatization scheme has been applied to texts from the late 1400's to the early 1900's, thus making those texts fully comparable at the level of their metadata. If Katrina's experiment gives us hope that OCR texts can with acceptable human intervention be turned into good enough TEI editions, these editions can without trouble be morphosyntactically tagged and become part of a Book of English. That is a lot of interoperable content.&quot; (Tools &amp; Content Partners working group, Fleshing out ideas for Demonstrators, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.english.northwestern.edu/people/mueller.html&quot;&gt;Martin Mueller&lt;/a&gt;, 11/28/08)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Piers Plowman Background Piers Plowman is a Middle English poem attributed to William Langland. It is written in unrhymed alliterative verse into sections called Passus. It stands next to Chaucer's Canterbury Tales as one of the great early English poems. A large number of versions exist. Professor Miceal Vaughan is an expert on the &quot;A&quot; version of the poem. The most popular version and the one found widely is the &quot;B&quot; version of the poem. Some indication of the various texts and fragments of texts can be seen at Harvard University's Piers page at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.courses.fas.harvard.edu/~chaucer/special/authors/langland/&quot; title=&quot;http://www.courses.fas.harvard.edu/~chaucer/special/authors/langland/&quot;&gt;http://www.courses.fas.harvard.edu/~chaucer/special/authors/langland/&lt;/a&gt;. Early Vaughan digital copy: About 10 years ago Professor Vaughan and a graduate student wrote an HTML version of Piers Plowman and mounted it on Vaughan's website. It was publicly available for student use and teaching. This file featured custom JavaScript and style code. With the development/change of HTML browsers, by 2006 the HTML version of Piers Plowman no longer worked in Internet Explorer. In short, to continue to use Piers Plowman in teaching, a new digital version was required. Motivation of a new digital version: Vaughan wished to re-edit the poem with new commentary, and produced both paper and a new HTML version. In effect, however, his earlier electronic version was being held hostage by the HTML presentation technology. Vaughan received a grant from the Simpson Center for the Humanities at the Unversity of Washington for support of his re-editing efforts, but the grant stipulated that he work with another faculty member at the University of Washington. He contacted Terrence Brooks of the Information School and requested technical support in his project to produce a new digital version of the Piers Plowman. Structuring a middle English poem: The first task was the development of an XML Schema for the poem. The following diagram outlines some of the complexity of the structural model of the poem. This chart illustrates that the Prologue of the poem can be composed of many individual lines and that each line may contain many words. Each word could fall into three categories: Old reading/New reading/both. Individual words could appear with a gloss term of explanation and a Middle English spelling. Any given line of the poem could also have numerous footnotes. &quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Scholarly Narratives emerged from W2, describing or exemplifying practices, work, tools and collaboration the community believed should impact and should be impacted by the work of Project Bamboo.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;I stumble upon &quot;promise&quot; here, because I remember working for a short time with a team at Indiana University back in the early nineties which had been commissioned by AT&amp;T to work on what it was calling a &quot;WorldBoard.&quot; (I think the term was supposed to stand in contrast with the electronic bulletin boards of the time, for those who are old enough to remember, in being &quot;location-aware&quot; information.) Fifteen years later and it doesn't really seem like we've made all that much progress. There is KML and there is the Dublin Core. But there is nothing like a Zotero that allows one either to write data to some sort of common database or to &quot;browse&quot; it. I bring up Zotero here because I find myself using it and liking it. It's not the world's greatest UI, but it offers a fair amount of flexibility for me as a particular researcher and it seems on its way to offering a way to share information with me as part of a greater collective of individuals studying humans as they move through the world. I can even imagine Zotero becoming a kind of front-end for prior &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;The Bamboo Planning Project received funding from the Andrew W.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's not enough to simply discover relevant digital content -- scholars need to be able to re-purpose and manipulate digital resources (including derivatives and representations of resources), making use of repository-independent tools and being able to reference resources used via persistent URIs and in accord with bibliographic citation standards. This requires that content providers describe and make digital resources available in accord with standards that support interoperability and integration. It requires tool builders to construct tools that can ingest resources without regard to brand or location of repository and can generate output and new derivatives that persist and are themselves referenceable. Additionally, while newer tools and repositories are more sensitive to the need for integration and conformance to emerging standards, additional services and frameworks are needed to glue everything together more seamlessly, which is where Bamboo might come in. This demonstrator focuses on exploitation of digital image resources using a simple Djatoka-based Web application. Djatoka is a robust, repository-independent image manipulation tool through which users and other applications can transform and manipulate Web-addressable digital image resources and create new cropped, rotated, and re-sized derivative image resources with persistent identifiers. The illustration scenario used hints at the potential benefits to be realized when quality digital content and tools like Djatoka are integrated in support of scholarship, but it also highlights the clusimness of current methods used to integrate digital content and tools.&quot; (Tools &amp; Content Partners working group, Djatoka-based image cropping demonstrator, 1/9/09)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sound archives have reached a critical point in their history marked by the simultaneous rapid deterioration of unique original materials, the development of powerful new digital technologies, and the consequent decline of analog formats and media. Motivated by these concerns, in 2005 the Indiana University Archives of Traditional Music and the Archive of World Music at Harvard University began Phase 1 of Sound Directions: Digital Preservation and Access for Global Audio Heritage - a joint technical archiving project with funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities. One major goal of the project was to test emerging standards and develop best practices for audio preservation. The project created a number of software tools that may be placed into service including the Harvard Sound Directions Toolkit - a suite of forty open-source, scriptable, command line interface tools that streamline workflow, reduce labor costs, and reduce the potential for human error in the creation of preservation metadata and in the encompassing preservation package. To aid selection for preservation, Indiana University developed the Field Audio Collection Evaluation Tool (FACET), which is a point-based, open-source software tool for ranking field collections for the level of deterioration they exhibit and the amount of risk they carry. These tools are all open source. Indiana also developed the Audio Technical Metadata Collector (ATMC) software for collecting and storing technical and digital provenance metadata. Harvard also produced Audio Object Manager for audio object metadata creation and Audio Processing XML Editor (APXE) for collection of digital provenance metadata. These tools will be released as open source later after further development. On a broad scale, audiovisual preservation is a key, but often overlooked infrastructure need. Many new digital audio and video projects in the arts and humanities have the term &quot;archive&quot; as part of their description, but few are relying on sustainable digital preservation practices. Without attention to the preservation of audiovisual assets, many significant and irreplaceable documents in innumerable fields will be completely lost in the next few decades. The Sound Directions project presents a model for other archives to use, but there is a critical lack of facilities and funding for the necessary transfer of analog collections across the country. Even at the Archives of Traditional Musicâone of the partners in Sound Directionsâ at the current rate of transfer there is not enough existing personnel or funding to effectively preserve their holdings. One of the options they are exploring at Indiana University is a campus-wide or even regional facility that would support preservation transfers. They are in the midst of surveying the audio and video holdings on the entire campus to assess the scope of the needs that exist. Needs are not limited to analog source recordings, either. Most scholars and even many special collections are not equipped to handle the long-term stewardship of born-digital recordings. Another broad need is for equivalent standards and best practices in the field of video preservation to match those that now exist for audio preservation.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Scholarly Narratives emerged from W2, describing or exemplifying practices, work, tools and collaboration the community believed should impact and should be impacted by the work of Project Bamboo.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Generally, scientists have workflow problems that often limit their abilities to effectively organize, preserve, and disseminate their data and research materials. There is also a need for better methods of retrieving, connecting, and relating data to published research accounts, especially beyond the data presented for publication. A lack of clear policies guiding the storage and preservation of data despite the requirements of funding agencies exacerbates the data problem. At the same time, standards, guidelines, and technological assistance, whether developed and implemented locally or nationally, all need to be sensitive to personal and disciplinary practices, which vary widely. The data challenges faced in the sciences may offer a prescient view of how humanities and social sciences scholars will confront their needs to preserve and make accessible increasingly complex research collections, many of which are data intensive in their right, especially in the social sciences.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Scholarly Narratives emerged from W2, describing or exemplifying practices, work, tools and collaboration the community believed should impact and should be impacted by the work of Project Bamboo.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Using things in different ways in different purposes, it doesn't achieve interoperability - why not chuck it and roll your own? But it's better to not go alone, you say. ECCO texts we're trying to bring in [to MONK]. Data store includes different kinds of data. &quot;Needless and heedless divergence&quot; - a lot of work, but a ot of problems can be solved by supplementary conventions. TEI level 4 guidelines, if you'd spent 2 hours about what to do re recommendations of soft hyphens, a lot less grief. A lot of difference s in encoding practice are unmotivated, unnecessary, accidental. One of roles for PB is reducing accidental divergence across data collections.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;For a sufficiently uniform format: first requirement for doing things with it. Argument - what's a sufficiently uniform level? You need to have this in the presence of examples of things, communities. TEI hasn't risen to solve problem of interchange, not an error in approaching the problem, but most resources haven't been interchanged yet. Building them in &quot;clumps&quot; without any &quot;runners&quot;. Data interoperates within clumps, but not a system of clumps and runners yet.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 3 (January 12 - 14, 2009) built off the progress of the Working Groups.

<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is also a moment to acknowledge the extraordinary success of the TEI Consortium at creating standards that cut across languages and millennia. There is a global and tightly knit community there, and a question that arises in the encoding of a French medieval manuscript may find its answer in a practice developed in the encoding of Buddhist manuscripts in Kyoto. To my mind, the TEI community is a remarkable example of a scholarly group that has global breadth, temporal depth, and is united in a common purpose to use technology to help with philological problems of long standing.&quot; (Tools &amp; Content Partners working group, Analyzing Scholarly Narratives, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.english.northwestern.edu/people/mueller.html&quot;&gt;Martin Mueller&lt;/a&gt;, 3/27/09)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Moving from the very large to the very small, there is a scholarly narrative about an electronic edition Langland's Piers Plowman(0031). A nice project, but to judge from the code examples, a project that stands entirely outside the richly collaborative work of medievalists who use the TEI. That seems to me on the face of it a big mistake, and I would make a similar point about a Donne project at Texas A&amp;M (not in the scholarly narratives). In both these cases, we have thoughtfully designed but idiosyncratic encoding schemes that almost guarantee the impossibility of using the data outside their original project.&quot; (Tools &amp; Content Partners working group, Analyzing Scholarly Narratives, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.english.northwestern.edu/people/mueller.html&quot;&gt;Martin Mueller&lt;/a&gt;, 3/27/09)&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;One thing I miss in the scholarly narratives is attention to well-curated archives of texts written in English, especially texts before 1923 that are in the public domain. Interoperable documents, textual or otherwise, are highly desirable, and 'interoperability' has certainly been mentioned often in the two Bamboo conferences I attended. The ability to range quickly among many texts may well be the most important advantage of the digital medium. If you have one book and one reader, the computer adds comparatively little. If you have one researcher and a thousand texts or more, the digital medium shines. American universities have taken the lead in creating highly curated and interoperable textual archives such as the TLG, the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative, or the Tibetan Buddhist archive with which I began this posting. Where is the sufficiently comprehensive, sufficiently well curated, and fully interoperable archive of texts in English? There are tons of digital texts here and there, but it is difficult or impossible to get them to play well with each other. From the perspective of textually oriented research, this very anecdotal review of some scholarly narratives raises some general agenda items for scholars and librarians. &quot;Only connect,&quot; the motto from Howards End may be a good tag line. A digital edition should always be done on the basis of a standard, in practice the TEI. If goals cannot be realized within that standard, it should use the standard as far as it will and use extension beyond it, but in such a way that the edition can be 'stepped down' to be interoperable with other texts. At the level of library collections, much more attention needs to be given to making text archives interoperable. Even more importantly, libraries need to start thinking of digital 'repositories' beyond the simple model of a digital shelf from which readers will pick this or that book for reading. The digital repository needs to be rethought as a laboratory in which entire collections or subsets become objects of complex manipulations.
