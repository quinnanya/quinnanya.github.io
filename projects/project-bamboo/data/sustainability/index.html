Take advantage of Bamboo technologies, maybe even contribute back. This is EXCEPTIONALLY critical, what sustainability after the planning process.&#34; (Day 2, 1a)&#34;What role does quasi-market play in the sustainability of such humanities projects?&#34; (Ex 2, 1b-E)&#34;have built large database of social science data; 5 year project.  for social science scholars, but also for the public.  Funding has run out, can&#39;t find funding to continue; &#34;on life support&#34; through library.  Katz&#39;s law, &#34;costs more to maintain a database than to build it.&#34; Confronting this a lot. Get funding to build something, scholars come to rely on it, but when funding runs out, isn&#39;t clear how that it will be supported over time.&#34; (Ex 2, 1d-G)&#34;conference experience of nobody presenting on what are their research tools, but presenting new tools that are never followed up upon. Couple years later, it&#39;s all washed away.&#34; (Ex 4, 1c-A)&#34;Problem of one-off technology &gt; You&#39;re not likely to curate beyond immediate needs of project&#34; (Ex 5, 1c-D)&#34;Are the wikis short or long lived? For the MFA it persists for the life of the program. Who supports it? Who is paying for it? Our staff is paying for it supporting it. Is it institutional? No, it should be. We don&#39;t have a system support. ITS is responsible, but the divisional liaisons responsibility. ITS central cut is more likely.&#34; (Ex 6a, 1a-C)&#34;Persistence of older technologies is something Bamboo should take into account. Realizes she needs to attend to both digital and non-digital archival concerns.&#34; (Ex 6a, 1b-B)&#34;Shared project sustainability&#34; (Ex 6b, 1d-F)&#34;project sustainability levels - is it eligible for the sustainability program&#34; (Ex 7, 1a-F)&#34;sustainability varies by institution, too&#34; (Ex 7, 1a-F)&#34;business model issues... need a capital campaign for sustaining collaborative services.

Creating a pool of humanities users who are savvy, but there is a huge pool of them that do not even have money for PCs.&#34; (Ex 7, 1a-H)&#34;Sustainability: must be something to contribute, and something to receive from the Bamboo process.&#34; (Ex 7, 1c-A)&#34;Like funding agency and archives: get a sense of tools and what humanists can use. Not necessarily conventional tools, either: genome tools, etc. are fair game. Which of these tools should we guarantee the sustainability of?&#34; (Ex 7, 1c-A)&#34;Institutional buy-in. You really need this in order to gain sustainability. If you identify your portfolio of tools, you can present these to other institutions, get their buy-in, and better ensure sustainability of those tools, which helps gain buy-in and more tools.&#34; (Ex 7, 1c-A)&#34;Network effect - who wants the only telephone in the world? For every tool developed, should be 3 institutions capable to develop. For every tool Bamboo might develop, need 3 scholars in different institutions who&#39;ve contributed, believe has value, etc. Not issue of whether you need Bamboo, but whether it&#39;s enough of a priority&#34; (Ex 7, 1c-C)&#34;International infrastructure that provides longevity. All individual databases and products; what will happen to them in the future? Bamboo could investigate necessary infrastructure to curate it. Like what national libraries took on to preserve print record, then translate it to the digital world. Not every institution can provide these services, so how can Bamboo facilitate consortial organizations or just do it so individual institutions can focus on just local services&#34; (Ex 7, 1d-D)&#34;Sustainability, cost and scale - how is it economically viable to permanently store data on a server for anyone anywhere?&#34; (W2, Analyzing Directions, Group B)&#34;one thing about the service-oriented approach, it makes your tools more sustainable; can switch out the technology easily and substitute it with another. need to make sure you can get your data out of the tools and so if you want to change tools you need to be able to get your data out. tools etc also need to be integrated in what people already do">

<p>"There are certain services you're going to depend on - you know it'll be there because there's copies around the world, data's always there. But I'm a researcher w/ a cool thing under my desk. If another scholar or service provider connects to that, I need to know about that service -it may be the best, but if it's R&D I need to know (not discover) the risks.
