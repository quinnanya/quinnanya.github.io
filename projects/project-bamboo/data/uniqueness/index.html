        <p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;See an enormous range of work, but here as an optimist, it is possible to identify common needs, but won't mean a reduction to lowest common denominator.  Yes is range, diversity, but in the end there are common practices&quot; (Day 1, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1a (Berkeley; April 28-30, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1a (Berkeley; April 28-30, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1a&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Don't lose the unique part in the hunt for commonalities:  B1 is an art historian and a China specialist ... when the &quot;common tool&quot; doesn't fit the specialized needs of a scholar &quot;diminishes what a specialized scholar can do&quot; -- it's an impediment not a boon.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; accomplish=&quot;&quot; questions=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; regarding=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; accomplish=&quot;&quot; questions=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; regarding=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 1&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-C)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;strike balance between generalizability research models and contextually-specific models? The boutique and contextually rich examples.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; accomplish=&quot;&quot; questions=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; regarding=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Initial Impressions and Questions: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; hope=&quot;&quot; bamboo=&quot;&quot; will=&quot;&quot; accomplish=&quot;&quot; questions=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; regarding=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 1&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1d&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-H)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;what qualifies as a good argument can vary widely from discipline to discipline&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Exploring Scholarly Practice: &quot; during=&quot;&quot; a=&quot;&quot; really=&quot;&quot; good=&quot;&quot; day=&quot;&quot; term=&quot;&quot; research=&quot;&quot; cycle=&quot;&quot; etc.=&quot;&quot; what=&quot;&quot; productive=&quot;&quot; things=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; relation=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; humanities=&quot;&quot; how=&quot;&quot; accomplish=&quot;&quot; that=&quot;&quot; task=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Exploring Scholarly Practice: &quot; during=&quot;&quot; a=&quot;&quot; really=&quot;&quot; good=&quot;&quot; day=&quot;&quot; term=&quot;&quot; research=&quot;&quot; cycle=&quot;&quot; etc.=&quot;&quot; what=&quot;&quot; productive=&quot;&quot; things=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; relation=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; humanities=&quot;&quot; how=&quot;&quot; accomplish=&quot;&quot; that=&quot;&quot; task=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 2&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-A)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They want to have tools that give maximum personalization options, so each scholar can tailor a program to his/ her process.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Exploring Scholarly Practice: &quot; during=&quot;&quot; a=&quot;&quot; really=&quot;&quot; good=&quot;&quot; day=&quot;&quot; term=&quot;&quot; research=&quot;&quot; cycle=&quot;&quot; etc.=&quot;&quot; what=&quot;&quot; productive=&quot;&quot; things=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; relation=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; humanities=&quot;&quot; how=&quot;&quot; accomplish=&quot;&quot; that=&quot;&quot; task=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Exploring Scholarly Practice: &quot; during=&quot;&quot; a=&quot;&quot; really=&quot;&quot; good=&quot;&quot; day=&quot;&quot; term=&quot;&quot; research=&quot;&quot; cycle=&quot;&quot; etc.=&quot;&quot; what=&quot;&quot; productive=&quot;&quot; things=&quot;&quot; do=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; relation=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; humanities=&quot;&quot; how=&quot;&quot; accomplish=&quot;&quot; that=&quot;&quot; task=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 2&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1b (Chicago; May 15-17, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1b&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-D)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Best practices - seems in conflict. Hard to imagine it capturing the processes we are talking about. How do we build best practices? How do you distill it into a best practice? Tension betw algorithms and heuristics?  Not codifiable. For the heuristic quality - to provoke rather than disclose&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Common and Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; common=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; that=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; emerged=&quot;&quot; from=&quot;&quot; your=&quot;&quot; exploration=&quot;&quot; of=&quot;&quot; scholarly=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; based=&quot;&quot; on=&quot;&quot; discussion=&quot;&quot; two=&quot;&quot; piqued=&quot;&quot; the=&quot;&quot; curiosity=&quot;&quot; those=&quot;&quot; at=&quot;&quot; table=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; uncommon=&quot;&quot; makes=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; and=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Common and Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; common=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; that=&quot;&quot; have=&quot;&quot; emerged=&quot;&quot; from=&quot;&quot; your=&quot;&quot; exploration=&quot;&quot; of=&quot;&quot; scholarly=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; based=&quot;&quot; on=&quot;&quot; discussion=&quot;&quot; two=&quot;&quot; piqued=&quot;&quot; the=&quot;&quot; curiosity=&quot;&quot; those=&quot;&quot; at=&quot;&quot; table=&quot;&quot; or=&quot;&quot; uncommon=&quot;&quot; makes=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; and=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 3&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1d&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-G)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Descriptive vs. predictive models? I've never been predictive. I've done predictive; did a search for the predictive feature, then went out searching for what it predicted. Model and hypotheses. Both descriptive and predictive models - &quot;All Victorian novels can be marked up this way&quot; - try to find one that doesn't work with it&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking a Commonality: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Unpacking a Commonality: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 4&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1d (Princeton; July 14-16, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1d&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-E)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Highly heterogeneous. Cannot come up with a convergence because of variances. Need a common means for incubating these different approaches.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking the Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Unpacking the Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1c&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-A)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Most people like to think that what they're going is uncommon and unique. One person might be able to help them because he's seen people doing similar things before, but this can a hard sell. Not recognizing these themes is a barrier: people are slow to recognize that there might already be appropriate tools. One can take the notion that there are things that can't be captured in a normative way too far. People have a notion of the uncommon.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking the Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Unpacking the Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1c&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-A)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Certain things have to be done in a way that's peculiar to the case at hand. The uncommon observation is that it's idiosyncratic. Do not presume that things are non-idiosyncratic.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking the Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Unpacking the Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1c&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-A)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We're looking to accommodate the weirdest of the humanities. What should not be accommodated? What should be left open and not put within the rigid structures? It's the fuzzy stuff. Serendipity, eureka. You can't create metadata for that. It's a process that everyone goes through, so it's common, but it's uncommon because of the particulars of each.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Unpacking the Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Unpacking the Uncommon: &quot; what=&quot;&quot; discrete=&quot;&quot; practices=&quot;&quot; are=&quot;&quot; involved=&quot;&quot; in=&quot;&quot; these=&quot;&quot; themes=&quot;&quot; outstanding=&quot;&quot; issues=&quot;&quot; need=&quot;&quot; to=&quot;&quot; be=&quot;&quot; addressed=&quot;&quot; regards=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ex 5&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.&quot;&gt;1c&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;-A)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm interested in the politics of mess. I'm interested in the process of knowing mess. I'm interested, in particular, in methodologies for knowing mess. My intuition, to say it quickly, is that the world is largely messy. It is also that contemporary social science methods are hopelessly bad at knowing that mess. Indeed it is that dominant approaches to method work with some success to repress the very possibility of mess. They cannot know mess, except in their aporias, as they try to make the world clean and neat. So it is my concern to broaden method. To imagine it more imaginatively. To imagine what method - and its politics - might be if it were not caught in an obsession with clarity, with specificity, and with the definite.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Scholarly Narratives emerged from W2, describing or exemplifying practices, work, tools and collaboration the community believed should impact and should be impacted by the work of Project Bamboo.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Generally, scientists have workflow problems that often limit their abilities to effectively organize, preserve, and disseminate their data and research materials. There is also a need for better methods of retrieving, connecting, and relating data to published research accounts, especially beyond the data presented for publication. A lack of clear policies guiding the storage and preservation of data despite the requirements of funding agencies exacerbates the data problem. At the same time, standards, guidelines, and technological assistance, whether developed and implemented locally or nationally, all need to be sensitive to personal and disciplinary practices, which vary widely. The data challenges faced in the sciences may offer a prescient view of how humanities and social sciences scholars will confront their needs to preserve and make accessible increasingly complex research collections, many of which are data intensive in their right, especially in the social sciences.&quot; (&lt;span class=&quot;glossary-term&quot; title=&quot;Scholarly Narratives emerged from W2, describing or exemplifying practices, work, tools and collaboration the community believed should impact and should be impacted by the work of Project Bamboo.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;If we're successful, we'll create what is &quot;new backwaters&quot; in the humanities - places where there are unique needs not filled by kinds of things that PB is going to generalize into infrastructure.
