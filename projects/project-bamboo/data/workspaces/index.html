<p>"Isn't it about tagging and bagging? Bagging into conceptual bins, maybe one object in multiple bins. Tagging w/ something that distinguishes in those bins, or strikes you, something that's a mnemonic. This would really work for hybrid system; whether you're in research library looking at document you can't take away, or have digital file - if there's enough of that tagging to get you back to it, and can put into multiple categories... If you could set up some kind of paradigm saying these are important categories and tags, these are kind of what Windows does in Word, it's slightly inefficient but it wouldn't take care of hybridity but would give you access. Once I have those photocopy pages, there's a physical process of juxtaposing pages. You put the materials together, you could do it on the screen, but the problem is hybridity of documents. More than bagging and tagging, also ordering. Also difference where while you're doing project work, they do take an awful lot of time to do (workflows, databases, ways for people to manage information) but it's different when you're doing your own thing" (<span class="glossary-term" title="Unpacking the Uncommon: " what="" discrete="" practices="" are="" involved="" in="" these="" themes="" outstanding="" issues="" need="" to="" be="" addressed="" regards=""><abbr title="Unpacking the Uncommon: " what="" discrete="" practices="" are="" involved="" in="" these="" themes="" outstanding="" issues="" need="" to="" be="" addressed="" regards="">Ex 5</abbr></span>, <span class="glossary-term" title="Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier."><abbr title="Workshop 1c (Paris; June 9-11, 2008), Understanding Arts and Humanities Scholarship, brought together interested parties from across the globe to discuss how they work, what challenges they face, and how Bamboo could make their jobs easier.">1c</abbr></span>-D)</p>

<p>"I am creating a database on the history of evolutionary and developmental biology. I am currently using two tools. The first is Zotero, an in-the-browser, reference management system. We use Zotero to keep track of key primary sources (scientific papers, images, video clips, etc.) and to add annotations to our files. We will then use Omeka, an interactive, online, environment to share the files. We chose Omeka for its flexibility of functionality. Specifically, it allows for the creation of complex narratives from the database materials as online exhibits (incorporating media rich files), allows for folksonomy and metadata from users, allows for the collection of electronic artifacts online, and has full search functions for user access of database materials. My technological wish list would be for a patch that would allow Zotero and Omeka to work together. This way we could easily move between updating Zotero and Omeka. The other alternative would be to have an all-in-one working environment (file management, data collection, notation, video streaming, and tagging) that can also act as a robust publishing environment. The specific forms of expertise that I need at this point are a technologist to help me install and manipulate Omeka (hopefully she could help write code to bridge Omeka with Zotero). Also, I could use an information architect and a designer to help me design an attractive and workable interface. Finally, I could use some legal support to help secure permission for articles, images, and film and video clips."
