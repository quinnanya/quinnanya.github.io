<h3>Meet Sam.</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/quinnanya/15639123332" title="Sam in the little house by Quinn Dombrowski, on Flickr"><img alt="Sam in the little house" height="427" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5614/15639123332_32bc30a4a5_z.jpg" width="640" /></a></p>

<h3>Sam is 11 months old, and is generally very happy.</h3>

<h3>Unless you're trying to get him to take a nap.</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/quinnanya/11762617635" title="Wah by Quinn Dombrowski, on Flickr"><img alt="Wah" height="427" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7349/11762617635_969820a373_z.jpg" width="640" /></a></p>

<h3>Since he was one month old, Sam has decided that naptime is oppressive.</h3>

<h3>(Seriously, this kid just hates naps. Even when they sneak up on him.)</h3>

<h3>Sam was going to go as SAMonella for his first Halloween.</h3>

<h3>But a few weeks ago, as he was fussing in his stroller, exhausted and refusing to sleep, we passed a row of political signs for upcoming ballot measures.</h3>

<h3>"Sam says 'vote no on N, no naps for babies!'," I quipped.</h3>

<h3>And we realized that we'd stumbled upon the perfect Halloween concept for Sam.</h3>

<h3>We made him a costume, and a sign, and some handouts.</h3>

<h3>Perhaps one of these handouts brought you to this page.</h3>

<p><em>Unfortunately, while we Googled for California ballot measures called N, we only came across a marijuana referendum in far northern California. Turns out there's an actual <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/Oakland_Unified_School_District_Parcel_Tax,_Measure_N_(November_2014)">Measure N in Oakland</a>. That sounds like a good measure, and the sort of thing Sam would support. So vote yes on Oakland Measure N if you can.</em></p>
