<p>"need also to think about WHY people would use a higher-level social networking tool, one that's not just limited to people in our fields? do we need to think more about what the social network is enabling? is it communicating or is it presenting researchers with their own page? what are we trying to facilitate a network to do? if we could produce the information once and distribute it---this is what an ideal social network would do" (<span class="glossary-term" title="Workshop 2 (Oct. 15-18, 2008) brought participants together to discuss the Directions that emerged from the data analysis conducted on the wiki.

<p>"also, think about renaming "social network"---perhaps call it academic network? scholarly network? you could use social networks just as a model and build someting quite specific that doesn't have ads etc. to sell it to colleagues, need to think about what problem this social network solves. there are ways of thinking about characteristics of social networks; what's really needed is a definition of what would make a scholarly network "scholarly"? what do people want it to do? there is a need to be very careful to not reinvent the monkish nature of arts and humanities practice; are we talking about building something that retains an old way of doing arts and humanities scholarship? maybe what scholarly network means is that it's an easy way to bring together a group of scholars across geographies, disciplines, time and space, to examine/study some group of texts or images?"

<p>"Encourage not just how they work now, but encourage collaboration of humanities scholars with people from sciences and technical side. Bias from previous work that a lot of this has to start with face-to-face communication, then continue virtually - prefer face-to-face to start. Replicating in new media what people do already, establishing new modes and frameworks that are only possible/facilitated by a scholarly networking software. I don't rule that out, and we don't have to replicate it with a new network, but I'm arguing that w/o the purpose/goal/shared engagement in some objective, the communication network is just a network, no purpose as such. Learn how it can best perform if we have specific projects to work on. Start it with some particular project in mind, they have similar goals, you'd see connections - ultimately you want to facilitate people finding people, related activities/papers/projects/etc via this collaborative tool." (Scholarly Networking working group, 12/9 meeting notes)</p>
<p>"Arguing for a Humanities Scholar Facebook? That's what I heard being talked about at the first two workshops - re-presenting this information; I can see how Humanities could take advantage of that; I haven't been on Facebook long, but it's interesting to find the people that want to connect back up with you. Different ways Facebook has enabled people to find you; different ways to let people find each other - common data, from the same university, using the same technique on different data sets; some means of allowing people to get connected via different metrics. If you add grouping potential of applications for social networking, could follow up on a conference group. Some way to facilitate self-organization; Facebook does that, ManyEyes allows grouping- can be formed in any way, self-defined. Start this scholarly group on Facebook? It has many qualities we like, it's already established - now we just need to seed it, be the nucleus for something self-forming. There was some negativity about Facebook, rather, looking at the features of Facebook, LinkedIn, a number of other ones; Brainify - more scholarly. What is the "project"? Needs to be some kind of purpose to it, common project." (Scholarly Networking working group, 12/9 meeting notes)</p>
<p>"Working on a project/platform that has evolved to look at how scholars communicate, how they network - Thought Ark (<a href="http://www.thoughtark.com" title="http://www.thoughtark.com">http://www.thoughtark.com</a>), repository of personal information, can be shared with colleagues; the most important feature is the processes of adding metadata to citations that scholars use as they use them - can be any sort of scholarly resource; citation increases the value; about halfway done. Can we use it in some sort of way? Could this be a demonstrator? This is not a gadget; there's research on scholarly practice that goes with it; it's not a publication platform, it tries to track uses (resources, scholarly practices); this is how I'm proposing it for our discussion. Want to determine metrics that people are going to want to use to find other resources, information about things, people/projects/etc. Metrics are built into the system; the most valuable aspect of the platform is that it monitors research/social networking activities. As research engages in activities, these are used for generating value data for the social connection and resources that researcher uses, so you can tell which resources are more/less utilized -> value." (Scholarly Networking working group, 12/9 meeting notes, <a href="http://www.matei.org/">Sorin Matei</a>)</p>
<p>Q: "When you join the system, do you assign attributes based on area of research?" Sorin: "Yes, categorized in multiple ways - integrate teaching and research; how you've gotten information as an instructor. Can categorize by field and discipline, can have original criteria, group/class-based, project, etc." Q: "You're going to want users to fill out a profile - do you have that?" Sorin: "Yes; architecture includes that." Q: "Can people control access to their info? - that came out a lot in the workshops." Sorin: "There are privacy controls built into the system, especially with intellectual products. If you decide not to share the paper you write in the system, you can do that; you can also have it not harvest your activities - but the system will die if too many people do that." Q: "Is part of the system connecting with other people so you're not necessarily ready to engage with them, but are looking and lurking and trying to find connections?" Sorin: "This is an open question; I have my own answer I can't share yet, this is a critical issue to discuss. Way of thinking of things proposed by Thought Ark can be used as a template or starting point; are there ways to do a Thought Ark-like platform. I'm committed to the platform, but I'm talking here as someone interested in architecture rather than a tool" (Scholarly Networking working group, 12/9 meeting notes, <a href="http://www.matei.org/">Sorin Matei</a>)</p>
<p>"Pushback from Facebook. Oriented less towards Facebook itself, have same functionality. I've used LinkedIn, but I don't like the feel as much. There's also open source stuff, not that we don't want to use Thought Ark but there's other tools that are open source that we could install. What are the capabilities we want to have? vs. trying to get something up. Can use four different tools - each has a different capability. Danger of spreading effort too thin to test out too many systems at once; concentrate on two, sharpening up a sense of the functionalities you do/don't want > identify where Bamboo would eventually go in terms of what it needs to do to build on existing resources. I imagine Bamboo wants to build something at some point that will be quite new and custom-made; I'm for exploring anything/everything in Facebook/LinkedIn, but my hunch is that Bamboo wants to build something almost from scratch, get all these opinions and visions together through workshops, then sit down and launch 1/2/3 projects that would be quite ambitious and autonomous. I don't see Bamboo just doing a small application that would sit on top of Facebook" (Scholarly Networking working group, 12/9 meeting notes)</p>
<p>"Not opposed to using existing tools, but none can do the job that what Bamboo wants to accomplish. It's a place for people to meet and have a laugh and share some information, but it's difficult to share information that we as researchers care about, especially intellectual property related information. Just like you would share a picture - look, enjoy, move on, but none of the processes we engage in. Need list of functions/features represented in those tools, it's these criteria that lead us to the recommendations. Need to keep an eye on this. Bamboo doesn't necessarily want to build from scratch if we can avoid it. "We're not closed, we're open, etc.:, we have to look really hard at what's available out there - when I look at Facebook, LinkedIn, etc, I see that there's certain things they do well, but the gist of what scholarly communication is about, identifying who knows what, trying to figure out if what they know is valid to me or not, has not been put together as a coherent and useful environment - I'm not talking just "tools", we don't have an environment for scholarly information processing. Discovery, publication, and social networking. Also, Connotea, other little projects that publishers have been dabbling with - this and that and everything but there's no one environment, but Bamboo needs to focus on this. However the environment will be brought to life by creating an integrated tool, or proposing standards - focus should be on The Environment, rather than tools in isolation." (Scholarly Networking working group, 12/9 meeting notes)</p>
<p>"How are we taking things forward? How about drafting a "roadmap" - areas of investigation? Suggestion of thinking of user requirements? What would they be when we talk about a social networking environment? Look at types of architecture(s) that would help users network and do research? Another area that looks at evaluating whatever's going to be created Let's focus on the higher level question for requirements - notion of being able to build and ask things so you can pull info from these other places; in a Fedora instance, or talk via Semantic Web via other entities that could exist from tools/repositories. We should think about doing things in a way that gives us the ability to extend things. To help this conversation, we should start with this initial document that has three headings. requirements, architecture principles. Interested in trying it out and seeing what sort of lessons we learn from that as a group as we're looking at demonstrators." (Scholarly Networking working group, 12/9 meeting notes)</p>

<p>"Tried to understand what sorts of things we might measure success against. Discarded some activity-based monitoring because of point about cultural change, how difficult it would be to predict use of the system. Did note that the system will naturally provide a lot of tracking data, good awareness of what use is being made. At the end of 3 years - small institution solution-- software or hosted service. Adoption as a measure of success-- at least 1 society engaging fully w/ network. Adoption in all project partners is a good goal. Up to 10 other institutions seems reasonable.

Also, would it be possible, or did the group think about extending the kinds of virtual environments listed here into things like portals, Vivo at Cornell (directory of faculty and related research interest labs, resources, etc). Or is emphasis squarely on more socially oriented networking sites?" <span class="glossary-term" title="Chad J.

Examples here, Sakai/Facebook/Ning, could be anything else. Different encivornments where people are already conducting work, how can people come to them? We can build all this capability to have a super-use of the atlas-- need for engineering purposes if nothing else. But content inside of atlas, services/capabilities developed over time, need to be able to be represented in ways that make sense for context of use and communities they're being used by. Don't always need all the info of the atlas, may only want small piece that connects relationships together. Maintaining that principle from the original scholarly networking group."

<p>Q: "Concern is still that, from own experience, a very tiny fraction are on social networking sites. Of the ones who are there, a small fraction have research in mind.
