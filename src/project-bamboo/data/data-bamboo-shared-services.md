Have to have some trust; Bamboo will have to partner with organizations and monolithic institutions to borrow their sustainability in that aspect. I'll only use a service if it's really relevant to what I have to do right now.

<p>"Clearly, a lot of our activity definitions are really recipes describing business processes or workflows and we still need to drill down and find the core technical services needed to orchestrate the worklow.The services atlas needs to expose these technical services, in contexts that help to identify pain points encountered by scholars trying to work on their selected problem, and therefore the work that needs to be done to enhance existing tools or build new tools that eliminate these pain points, resulting in greater efficiencies and effectiveness or new ways of doing things. The wedding cake or brick wall diagram is probably not the best way of representing these services because they are ubiquitous and can be used or re-used in many workflows. On the other hand, dozens or hundreds or thousands of recipes will not help to expose patterns and core recipes (or service usage models.) In this context, it will be important for scholars to have a basic understanding of what a shared technology service is, and the role it plays in the orchestration of workflows.

Some of the widgets and gadgets I might connect to and use; those could be there.

As we move into more volatile service environments, challenge is going to become greater in some ways. This question of migration across services is very real.

<p>"Concrete proposal: on shorter timeline, take projects like SEASR, Zotero, etc that are already out there, thinking about ways to interconnect, and form this as the basis for cyberinfrastructure.

Finding a "killer app" or "the service" or 3-5 capabilities that individuals can't support on their own, that could fall into the platform.

<p>"Look carefully at last of workplans - that discussion gave me sense of how we can get rapid inter-institutional leverage by being smart re: what we do. Technical specs prob not so clear to faculty/scholars, but bottom line is we could perhaps use PB as a framework. Could make use of resources at other institutions w/o doing a lot of paperwork (terms other institutions, contract,s etc) - this would be useful outcome, probably doable very quickly (start on it at least). Need more of those kinds of opportunities. Need to be more specific re: services/what we want to package here. Talk a lot about services, but there's few examples. Specificity is important to make more tangible. What services to include, which have a larger base? We've talked about Zotero - it's a nifty piece of work, but it's a piece of work that has a user base that is much bigger than PB, cuts across people in all disciplines.

<p>"We need to be a lot clearer about assumptions re: centralization vs. distributed things. I hear conflicting stories about that in the different parts of the plan, assumptions, maybe I'm just not understanding. Does appliance go in institutions, run by PB central? If each institution runs it, how do we deal w/ federation, backup services? How do we handle configuration management/upgrade? How do we deal w/ CIOs who are unhappy about standard config, because it doesn't map to what they think they're doing re: security. Talked about exposing campus services, content, maybe held at participant institutions/partners. Also talked about re-hosting onto these appliances. Going to want some mix of both - don't think that if Hathi Trust becomes a partner, don't necessarily want to replicate book scans in Appliances, unless you've got a huge budget for storage.

<p>"Even hosting our web page, we need some of this stuff. Some of this stuff is proof of concept (in the project sense). But we need some components up and running and "in production". Appliance piece needs to go forward so we'll have something to build on, minimize complexity across community. We have choices for what we want to say "first generation production stuff" - move forward with that, so we can do what we want in year 2/3/six months later. Challenge of thinking along the way - planing work we're doing now is pointing in a particular direction. Probably wouldn't think about it as proof of concept - this is Version 1, but Version 1 might be really bad and we might totally redo it for Version 2. Need components in place so ideas can advance elsewhere. Appliance is one of these ideas right now; Bernie and Steve have thought about scalability, more than two sites. Could probably do 2/3 and make it work, to call it "production" - we need to do that. Or we'll be perpetually piloting and testing, over and over - deliverables won't be there that people want to depend on / use.

<p>"Did talk about "refactoring" and what that might mean, because there's several different levels -- one form, as alluded to, is making it available as a virtual appliance. That's the simple and most plausible form - allows someone to take a thing and make it portable and useful. Other levels of refactoring, and even the term will probably shock people-- especially if they have a mature application, unless they're partnering to say "let's dissect my project, find out what you want to re-deploy in a more granular anatomy to make it useful in more environments than what it was engineered for".

<p>"Measures of success: how much of an effect can there be in one year? Probably not earth-shattering. Projects have a "Powered by Bamboo" sticker that you see. Pick some projects, big projects w/ well-established user base, and have Bamboo become the provider for at least one. Projects should have established user base so it'll reach more people. Have to work with existing content; have to be able to do this. PB should become a service, not content, provider. Shouldn't expect content. If PB provides services, and scholars create content, that'll prevent Google from getting there first. Basing interoperability on other big projects like Fedora.
