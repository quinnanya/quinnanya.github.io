<p>"How can PB add value at my institution? Group of small liberal arts institutions. We all had a neg impression for what possibilities would be for small lib arts inst. Does it make sense for us to continue to be involved? Want to stay positive- we can build something together that will be great. What can PB do that's creative, innovative, and will last that will entice people to use PB services. 3 small thoughts on what that could be:<br />
1. Bamboo Facebook - could PB make some sort of service that acts as scholarly orientation/organization for dig hum? Twitter people, poke your faculty friends, do digital scholarship, all Web 2.0 - don't have to have hard buildings for hum scholarship, could do it virtually. My faculty might be interested - we're in a small area in Virginia.<br />
2. Bamboo Marketplace - I have faculty asking "I just have a little small project, some Java code, something that will do this) - we don't have a Java programmer for your specific project, but what if there was a marketplace and look for people who might be selling their wares there. Java programmers with some background in the Humanities - like bringing something home from the marketplace and taking it home. Helps me - solved problem for faculty member. 3. Finally - float up a Bamboo cloud. Help me get out of storage business, high-performance computing. We're a small place - do I have to hire computationalists to run a comp cluster for 3 faculty members who run the same 5 codes as everyone else everywhere?"

<p>"One point I would underscore is the importance of Project Bamboo assisting smaller institutions. I represent one such institution, where our funding and resources are not abundant. However, we have collections that I am sure would be of interest to large and small institutions throughout not just our region, but outside our region as well. It would be great if Project Bamboo could serve, at least in part, as a consortium to aid and assist small institutions needing guidance, tools, and expertise from those more knowledgeable in digital humanities."
