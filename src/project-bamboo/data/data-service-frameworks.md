<p>"When one talks about tech infrastructure, it's not about tech infrastructure. It's always more complex than just "computing". Then there's networks for things that aren't geographically together. You can have a wonderful processing thing that depends on data elsewhere, but if network fails, there's nothing you can do. Different phases in technology - true for everything. There's a period where you're installing (design & implementation), then "operate" (different kind of function), and "support" (also different). Leaving any of these off leaves an incomplete picture. Unless you worry about the other pieces, we end up with nothing. Complicated even further that each can occur locally, replicated, and shared. Replication not the same as sharing; "how do I get that so I can install it?" - that's not sharing. Replicating is more easy than sharing, local implementation are easier than replicating. If we're doing what we're talking about with shared services, must not make that confusion. There's no right answer, but the mistake is forgetting about dimensions in the cube."

<p>"Q: I like how complicated you've made it- because it is. Is it even messier? We think about install/operate/support, but one of new models is perpetual beta - always changing. Would this be a model we should consider for Project Bamboo? <span class="glossary-term" title="Greg Jackson, Vice President & Chief Information Officer at the University of Chicago, was a Principal Investigator for the Bamboo Planning Project through September 2009."><abbr title="Greg Jackson, Vice President & Chief Information Officer at the University of Chicago, was a Principal Investigator for the Bamboo Planning Project through September 2009.">Greg Jackson</abbr></span>: People do perpetual beta for different reasons. Things are appropriately going to change, and don't want to freeze. Operating a system that's dynamically changing, part of the design. Not perpetual beta, but understanding things will change. 'Beta' is for limiting liability - this is ducking responsibility. Q: Constantly changing dynamic, and that's fine - but this kind of model is something that we assume a stable operating environment in which we have tasks and when tasks + technology + understanding of what we need are changing, then perhaps it's the first condition, a perpetual operating state that's in flux. <span class="glossary-term" title="Greg Jackson, Vice President & Chief Information Officer at the University of Chicago, was a Principal Investigator for the Bamboo Planning Project through September 2009."><abbr title="Greg Jackson, Vice President & Chief Information Officer at the University of Chicago, was a Principal Investigator for the Bamboo Planning Project through September 2009.">Greg Jackson</abbr></span>: There's no such thing- IT organization "architects" are there because there's no such thing as a stable operating environment; everything has to have clear principles and architecture behind it.We have to understand how evolving environment is going to affect applications."
