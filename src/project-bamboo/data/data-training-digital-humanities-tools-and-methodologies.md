<p>"quite accurate. In new hires, it takes a long time... it takes them twice as much time to prepare a lecture as for me. No mastery of tools. They have a better sense of connectedness and integration, but short on mastery and shortcuts. Traditionally, our library offers sessions [information literacy] on how to use the library. Intro to what kinds of databases we have & how to use them. Maybe there's another layer having to do with new tools & software. Junior faculty will not approach librarians to ask how to use new tools. One reason: librarians don't know themselves anymore. Nobody has much to say to YouTube generation. Ongoing reconciliation between subject bibliographers -- iterative relationship -- and faculty."

<p>"Need for graduate students to have more training in the variety of available tools to know what they can use for the work. Need for interdisciplinarity in tools.  How can they work better together? How can they work more effectively together? More training in technologies for graduate students and young scholars. Great investment in the UK in training graduate students in the humanities. Some training is generic (how to present a paper, etc.) Others in more specific straits. But what is missing is training in interdisciplinary technologies. Need a concerted investment by universities to train in technologies. Training is broadly interpreted as "anything that's good for you," need for specificity. Students seem to be technologically aware but there is no second level in specific technologies. There should be a different intuition in how to navigate in virtual environments. Perception among students that they understand technology, though there is a lack of specificity.  Students are a bit afraid of technology. What's there and what might be changing?  Important that students are made aware of this. Information technology is used according to specific tools, and when such a tool is supplanted they are unaware of the switch and how to use a new tool.  Need to approach this problem, but it's quite difficult to teach technologies on a large scale. So students don't know HTML, but can use a tool to produce HTML.  What's so bad about that? "It would be good to know that your car isn't driven by magic." They don't need to know the details, but they should be able to troubleshoot in the details if it's necessary. Interest in getting students to think about structured information. Need to create things for environments.  If one doesn't understand how new environments work, how can that happen? Is it necessary for a humanities scholar to understand how a book is printed. Not the right question, more of us are content providers now, so we need to have an idea how content environments circulate. Perhaps there was a time when printing knowledge was necessary. As we move into new environments, knowledge of these details are necessary. Putting stuff on the web and the like are tasks that are increasingly self-reliant. Used to give what would be on the web to a technology specialist, but this is changing. People are producing and posting their content directly. As people learn how to use interface without understanding what's behind the interface, they can't use the tool very effectively."

<p>"In English and the Comparative History of Ideas at the UW, students are trained to examine and critique the ways in which technology is culturally embedded, how it influences aesthetics, and how it shapes our understanding of the humane. However, these same students rarely have the opportunity to learn the technical skills required to produce the very objects they study. In Geography at the UW, there is a similar trajectory, yet in nearly the opposite direction: students often learn technical skills in geographic information systems (GIS) without becoming well-versed in qualitative or critical GIS, fields that consider technology to be value-laden. As such, we are designing a digital humanities curriculum that asks undergraduates to approach the concept of "mapping" in the digital humanites from two different perspectives."
