blurb: "The colors my daughter and I wore."

To make myself practice embroidery, I decided in January 2024 to keep track of the colors my daughter and I wore every day. Each month would have a different shape (January - star, February - heart, March - flower): filled in if the person was wearing a dress, and lines if it was separates. I also added a bead to the embroideries representing my outfits if I undressed and put them back on at some point during the day.

I struggled with space and planning (I'd intended for it to somehow turn into a circle), and I didn't know anything about embroidery -- including separating embroidery floss to make it easier to work with and to get finer lines. Before long, it was a struggle to force the needle through the absolute wild chaos of thread on the back.

I got through embroidering late March, though I kept tracking data until late April, before I gave up. Here's a few example outfits and the shapes they became.
